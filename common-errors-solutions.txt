Q1.

500: Internal server error

This error is generated when a script running on the server could not be implemented or permissions are incorrectly assigned for files or directories

Troubleshooting suggestions:

Temporarily disable any rewrite rules by renaming your .htaccess file if it exists.

Ensure that any CGI or Perl scripts have at least .755. permissions.

If trying to run PHP and you get this error, you may have an invalid php.ini in your /cgi-bin, or may be missing your php.dat file in this folder.

A1. Update PHP version on server




Q2.

However, on server all images you have added are in .webp format
Can you try reseting permalinks please?


A2.

I'll create a redirect in nginx for the directory sb-twitter-feed-images/ to redirect the jpg calls to webp

There must be a code provided by the plugin itself which is converting - if there is not, I'll try making one on my end

location /sb-twitter-feed-images/ { rewrite ^(.*)\.jpg$ $1.webp redirect; }

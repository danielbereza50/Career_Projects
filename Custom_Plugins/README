Postcard Creator JavaScript Plugin

1. I choose to develop the Post Card creator application because I always wanted to work with video streams and HTML canvas.  
I thought this would be a good opportunity to create a plugin that fullfills all of these requirements and to create something unique and 
helpful for Konica Minolta Business Solutions.


2. The way in which someone can use or test my plugin is simply downloading the most recent release of 
WordPress from https://wordpress.org/download/ onto your server, if any difficulties, here is an installation cookbook: 
https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Installation.  Then, login to the Dashboard --> Plugins --> 
Add New --> Upload Plugin --> Browse (or drag and drop here) or you can FTP into the website via client software like FileZilla and click on 
the installation folder you created --> WP Content --> Plugins and drag and drop the uncompressed master folder over to that directory.

  	When ever doing UX from scratch, use the following start to the code:

		<style>
		.flex-wrapper {
				display: flex;
				flex-wrap: wrap;
				justify-content: space-between;
				align-items: center;
		}
		.flex-item {
				width: 32%;
				height: auto;
		}
		@media screen and (max-width:980px){
			.flex-item {
				width: 50%;
				height: auto;
			}
		}
		@media screen and (max-width:768px){
			.flex-item {
				width: 100%;
				height: auto;
			}
		}
		</style>

			<div class = "flex-container">
			    <div class = "flex-wrapper">
				    <div class = "flex-item">
				    <!-- stuff goes here -->
				    </div>
	        		    <div class = "flex-item">
				    <!-- stuff goes here -->
				    </div>
			    </div>
		       </div>

			height: 200px;

			object-fit: contain;


			*Above the fold means within the viewport (not below the window height) 


			plugin in font family as the first value after loading .otf or .ttf file into project folder:

  		and 'data-item-number'
  
		<div data-post-id="5136" class="sc_services_item sc_item_container post_container with_content

	Designer thoughts: 

	a. the gallery vs. image modules, give the ability for images to be displayed in a lightbox (pop up) when 
	you click on them. this is especially important for people using a phone
	
	
	THIS IS IMPORTANT NOTE - b. if the pictures are in the first column of the first row, the user won't see the text until 
	they scroll through all of the pictures. 
	
	The copy is written very well, and I think anyone who intends on making a PURCHASE will read it.


	it's not a redesign, just a shuffling and refreshing of content.
	
	common section design: background image section with floating row thatr has heading text, body text, and button


	Leading addresses the vertical gaps between lines of text â€“ often crucial in the creation of magazine articles, blog pages, and other pieces of written work. 
	
	Kerning deals with the space between two characters or letters.
	
	Redesign or glaring issues?


 	when building landing page design, break on the exact words from the mockup

	* start with text logo, then build a graphic in canva

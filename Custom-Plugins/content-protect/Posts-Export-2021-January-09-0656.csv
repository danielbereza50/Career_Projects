72,"Caregiving and Maintaining a Career","A significant portion of those in the workforce are providing eldercare to aging family members.  Between 25 to 35 percent of all workers report that they are currently providing, or have recently provided, care to someone 65+.  Among baby boomer caregivers (those born between 1946-1964), an estimated 60 percent are working full or part-time.  Working caregivers often suffer work-related difficulties due to their dual caregiving roles. Among working caregivers caring for a family or friend aged 65+, two-thirds report having to rearrange their work schedule, decrease their hours or take an unpaid leave in order to meet their caregiving responsibilities.Difficulties due to work and caregiving are even higher among those caring for someone with dementia.

Employed caregivers tend to be younger and are responsible for three or four generations. It may take time to adjust work and family duties. Barriers in the community (office hours, poor accessibility for people with disabilities, etc.) can also create problems. In a recent survey nearly two-thirds of caregivers listed eldercare benefits in the workplace as their most pressing concern, trumping such evergreen healthcare issues as cost of care, patients rights and insuring the uninsured.

The issue of eldercare benefits has become especially important to women, since they make up approximately 72 percent of the caregivers in the United States.  Nearly half of those women are raising children under the age of 18 while concurrently caregiving.  This group is commonly referred to as the “sandwich generation” and is made up of those folks who are caught between taking care of both their parents and their children simultaneously. Working “female caregivers” are said to suffer a particularly high level of economic hardships due to their caregiving roles. Women caregivers are likely to spend 12 years out of the workforce raising children and caring for an older relative or friend.One recent study found that women who had assumed caregiver roles during their working years were 2.5 times more likely to live in poverty when they became elderly compared to women who had not been caregivers during their lifetime.  In addition, studies have found that women caregivers handle the most difficult caregiving tasks (i.e., bathing, toileting and dressing) when compared with their male counterparts who are more likely to help with finances. Female caregivers are also more likely than males to suffer from anxiety, depression, and other symptoms associated with emotional stress due to caregiving.  Indeed, eldercare is quickly catching up to childcare as the “hot button issue” facing female employees today and they want to know how their employers will assist them in the future.

Fortunately, corporate America has begun to recognize these trends. Eldercare has become one of the fastest growing work-family employee benefits to emerge in the past decade.  Estimates by MetLife put the aggregate costs of caregiving in lost productivity to U.S. business at about $11.4 billion per year.  In response to this, and subsequent research, about a third of Fortune 500 companies now offer ‘eldercare benefits’ above and beyond flextime.

When a caregiver is employed outside the home, various problems can develop. The work place may not be responsive to their situation. This can create problems with office hours, vacation, sick leave, personal leave and other benefits.  So, what exactly can an employee ask their employer to do to make their eldercare responsibilities easier? The benefits requested usually include some combination of the following:

<strong>Unpaid leave:</strong> All employees in the U.S. working for companies with 50 or more employees are eligible for this benefit under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.  This piece of legislation guarantees workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave, with retention of full medical and dental benefits. But the trend among nearly a quarter of Fortune 500 companies is to offer even more to their employees. Some companies, for instance, allow workers to take up to one year of unpaid leave for every two years of employment; most receive full medical and dental for the first six months and their seniority and jobs are guaranteed upon their return.

<strong>Referral services:</strong> These services link employees with a range of eldercare services nationwide, making it possible to arrange for the care of a parent across town or across the country. Referrals are the most common approach to eldercare assistance and are offered by nearly all employers with eldercare programs. Referral services help employees find everything from check writing services to bonded help for at-home care.

<strong>Eldercare reimbursement:</strong> Similar to childcare reimbursement, this benefit helps employees manage financial obligations. A percentage of the employee's paycheck is automatically deducted and set aside, then reimbursed at the end of the year.

<strong>Long-term-care insurance (LTC):</strong> LTC insurance is becoming an increasingly common benefit – it was offered by about 25 percent of employers with eldercare programs last year. Since the beneficiaries of long-term-care insurance can vary, sometimes it can be extended to parents or even parents-in-law.

<strong>Counseling:</strong> Usually offered through an employee-assistance program, counseling is available for the employee and family members affected by caregiving stress, some companies even extend this benefit to the aging parent.

<strong>Flexible spending account:</strong> This benefit eases the strain of paying the medical expenses for an older person in your care. From your pretax income, money is automatically set aside and reimbursed upon receipt of health-related expenses.

Even if benefits exist on paper, most employees say their supervisor's attitude and behavior also influences the usage of eldercare benefits. Some managers send mixed signals if employees try to use the benefit; the success of eldercare programs in the workplace is tied directly to managerial encouragement and supportiveness from the work environment.  Increasingly, companies are offering resource materials, counseling, and training programs to help caregivers.

If demographic projections and increased life expectancies bear out in the next 25 years, we can expect to have the largest senior population in U.S. history living longer than any other previous generation. For most of us, this is a good thing - it means we will be spending more years with our loved ones than ever before. For others, it is a mixed blessing that comes with its share of difficulties. Now that corporate America is paying attention, perhaps we can reduce those burdens.

77,"Home Safety for Your Aging Loved Ones","<span style=""font-size: 16px;"">The center for disease control reports that among people 65 years and older, falls are the leading cause of injury deaths and the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma. Each year in the United States, nearly one third of older adults experience a fall.  The majority of falls occur at home and most fractures reported by older adults are the result of a fall. Falls can lead to a tragic loss of an older person's independence and mobility. Given the vastly growing population of the 65<strong>+</strong> age group, the direct costs (nationally) for nonfatal injuries related to falls is expected to reach as much as $44 billion by 2020.</span>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Each year, more than 734,000 people over 65 are treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with stairs, bathtubs, furniture, carpeting and other products seniors live with and use every day. Thousands of these injuries are related to falls: 3,000 seniors each year fall while standing on chairs; 6,800 seniors trip on rugs or carpet runners. Many of these accidents could be prevented.  It is estimated that simple modifications to the interior of the house can cut a mature adults risk of falling in half.  Changes in furniture arrangement, housekeeping and lighting will definitely help reduce the risk of falling at home. Below is a list of important questions and answers to help you determine if your aging loved ones home, or your own home, is safe for a mature adult.</span>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: Where in the home is considered the most dangerous place that seniors need to be most careful?</strong></span>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;"">The bathroom is one of the most hazardous places in the home for accidents; the majority of broken hips are the result of slipping in the bathtub. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that there are more than 300,000 bathroom accidents each year and that 2.5 million adults over the age of 65 need special assistance in bathing.</span>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: What are some of the best things to do to prevent these bathroom accidents?</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Install grab bars on the bathroom walls near the toilet and along the bathtub or shower.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Place a slip-resistant rug adjacent to the bathtub for safe exit and entry.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Mount a liquid soap dispenser on the bathtub/shower wall.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Place nonskid adhesive textured strips on the bathtub/shower floor.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">A combination safety seat/transfer bench can be used in the bathroom to provide additional stability and comfort for transition in and out of the bathtub.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Stabilize yourself on the toilet by using either a raised seat or a special toilet seat with armrests.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Replace glass shower enclosures with non-shattering material.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Place night lights between the bathroom and bedroom to help for safe maneuvering at night.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: What about stairs and steps, what should be done?</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Make sure light switches are at both the top and bottom of the stairs.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Provide enough light to see each step and the top and bottom landings.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Keep flashlights nearby in case of a power outage.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Install handrails on both sides of the stairway and be sure to use them.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Do not leave objects on the stairs.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Consider installing motion detector lights, which turn on automatically and light your stairway.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Put nonslip treads on each bare-wood step.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Do not use patterned, dark, or deep-pile carpeting. Solid colors show the edges of steps more clearly.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Do not place loose area rugs at the bottom or top of stairs.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Repair loose stairway carpeting or boards immediately.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: What are some home safety tips for living areas?</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Arrange furniture to create clear pathways between rooms.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Remove low coffee tables, magazine racks, footrests, and plants from pathways in rooms.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Install easy-access light switches at entrances to rooms so you won't have to walk into a darkened room in order to turn on the light. Glow-in-the-dark switches may be helpful.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Secure loose area rugs with double-faced tape or slip-resistant backing. Recheck these rugs periodically.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Keep electric, appliance, and telephone cords out of your pathways, but don't put cords under a rug.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Eliminate wobbly chairs, ladders, and tables.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Do not sit in a chair or on a sofa that is so low it is difficult to stand up.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Place carpeting over concrete, ceramic, and marble floors to lessen the severity of injury if you fall.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Repair loose wooden floorboards immediately.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: How about the Kitchen?</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Remove throw rugs.</span></li>

	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Store food, dishes, and cooking equipment at easy-to-reach waist-high level.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Don't stand on chairs or boxes to reach upper cabinets. Use only a step stool with an attached handrail so you are supported.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Repair loose flooring.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Use nonskid floor wax.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: And Bedrooms?</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Clear clutter from the floor.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Place a lamp and flashlight near your bed.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Again, install night-lights along the route between the bedroom and the bathroom.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Sleep on a bed that is easy to get into and out of.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Keep a telephone near your bed.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: Do you have any additional home safety tips?</strong></span>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Yes, smoke detectors should be installed in the home and checked periodically to be sure that they work. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) home fires are more deadly than all others combined and for those individuals 65 or older, the fire death risk is twice as high as that of the average population.</span>

100,"Planning a Family Caregiving Meeting","If your family is like most, you don’t all live in the same city – or maybe not even within a day’s drive of one another!  You’re here and there, with jobs, families and responsibilities.  Regardless of your whereabouts many of the decisions and tasks of caring for an elderly parent must sometimes be handled as a <em>family</em>.  A good way to do that is with a family meeting.

The time to plan a family meeting is<em> before</em> your parent(s) has a crisis that requires immediate attention.  Be proactive.  Clues from your parent – such as increasing forgetfulness, missed medications or difficulties managing money, keeping house or getting to appointments – are all signs that a family meeting may be in order.  The following ten tips will help make your family meeting more efficient and productive.

<strong>Meet ASAP.</strong>  If a crisis has happened and you’re the primary caregiver, the sooner you hold the meeting, the sooner you can get help and the less time your family members have to get stuck in the comfortable rut of letting you do all the work.

<strong>Set the Agenda.</strong>  This meeting is serious business.  Make up an agenda just as you would if you were holding a business meeting.  Carefully consider which decisions need to be made and which tasks need to be completed.  Write them all down in advance.  If possible, mail, e-mail or fax a copy to all family members before meeting.  This will give them ample time to consider how they can best help before they meet with the entire group.

<strong>Establish Meeting Rules.  </strong>One person should lead the meeting.  Often, this is the person who is closest (either geographically and/or emotionally) to the parent and who will most likely be the primary caregiver.  In some cases, people have a family friend or less involved third party lead the meeting.  Make it clear that each person should treat the others with respect.  No shouting.  No interrupting.  No name-calling.  You get the idea.

<strong>Give Everyone Time to Talk.</strong>  Everyone should have the opportunity to provide input and have your full attention while they speak.  To ensure that even quiet family members get a chance to talk, give each one an allotted time.  You might want to call on them in alphabetical order or in order of age.

<strong>Ask for Volunteers.</strong>  Give everyone the opportunity to volunteer for particular tasks (such as locating legal documents, picking up your parent’s prescriptions, or hiring a home health care aide).  Before the meeting, decide whom you would choose for each job and make a list.  Consider your family members’ talents and interests – which jobs would they do well?  Which jobs would they most likely enjoy?  If no one volunteers for tasks, start recruiting based on your list.

<strong>Be Specific.  </strong>If you need help with certain caregiving tasks, be specific with your requests.  For example, “Mom gets a senior discount at the grocery store on Wednesdays.  Would one of you be able to take her to the grocery store each Wednesday morning?” or “I have to be out of town for business March 10 through 14.  Could one of you plan to check on her daily and be on call for her on those particular days?”

<strong>Focus on the Issue at Hand.</strong>  Your sister was rude to you last Thanksgiving.  Your brother’s rowdy kids practically wrecked your home.  Sure, you have grievances with your siblings, but now is not the time to bring them up or let them influence your decisions.  The family meeting is to discuss your parent’s – nothing more.  Stick to the task.

<strong>Look to the Future.</strong>  As you arrange your parent’s care for the here and now, don’t forget that health and abilities change – sometimes quickly.  Come up with a contingency plan – or at least the agreement to hold another family meeting if your parent’s condition changes and you need to make new arrangements or assign new responsibilities.

<strong>Establish a Spokesperson.</strong>  If your parent needs someone to communicate with his or her doctor and other health professionals, it’s much better to assign one person to the task.  Pick someone who is reliable, has good communication skills and is willing to keep other family members up to date regarding your parent’s health information.  Often this will be the primary caregiver, because this person has the main responsibility for their parent’s care and probably has the closest relationship with the medical team.

<strong>Request a break.</strong>  If family members live far from your parent and have difficulty participating in day-to-day care, request that they devote one week of their vacation time each year to give you a break.  If that’s not possible, at least ask for an occasional weekend.  Get them to commit to specific dates in writing.  Depending on your parent’s health, he or she may be able to travel to them or they may need to come to the parent.  The important thing is that you get time off to relax and rejuvenate away from your parent.

107,"Fostering Your Parent’s Independence","As we reach middle age and beyond, most of us have some degree of osteoarthritis (OA) – pain and stiffness of the joints caused by the breakdown of cartilage that normally cushions our joints.  While OA, often referred to as simply “arthritis,” can affect almost any joint, for many people, the joints of the hands are hit hardest.  As a result, gripping, grabbing and holding objects with one’s hands can be difficult.

OA of the hands and other problems, including strokes and neuropathy (nerve damage), can affect one’s ability to do many normal activities like dressing, combing one’s hair, preparing foods, doing craft projects or playing cards.  There are many simple and low-cost modifications you and your aging loved ones can do to make these tasks easier on sore, stiff or less-than-nimble hands.  Try a few of the following ten tips to help foster your parent’s independence – you might just be surprised how much easier they make every day tasks!
<p align=""center""><strong><em>TEN TIPS for LESS-THAN-NIMBLE HANDS</em></strong></p>
<strong>Get rid of buttons.</strong>  If your parent has trouble buttoning clothing, encourage her to look for clothes that pull over, pull up or zip.  For blouses and shirts that button, try this: Remove (or find a seamstress who can do it) the buttons and sew up the buttonholes.  Then sew the button over the buttonhole so that it shows on the front of the garment.  Finally sew Velcroâ squares beneath the buttons.  That way, the shirt always looks buttoned when your parent wears it.  To make zippers easier to zip, place a thin loop of fabric or yarn through the hole and tie the two ends together.  Your aging loved one can pull the zipper by placing a finger through the loop, eliminating the need to grip the tiny metal zipper.  If your parent is in a hurry to get dressed and you don’t have a loop of string handy, try a large safety pin in a pinch.

<strong>Build it up.  </strong>In order to make handles of products easy to hold, build them up with materials you have on hand.  Electrical or adhesive tape may work for the handles of hairbrushes, pots and pans and small gardening tools.  Those sponge curlers you may have used when you were younger work great over the handles of silverware, toothbrushes, small paintbrushes, pencils, etc.  You can also purchase pipe tubing from your local hardware store.  The material will slide easily over any utensils or items that have a handle, making the handle easier to grip.  It will also help prevent the item from slipping out of your parent’s hands if it is wet.

<strong>Help your parent use the strongest muscles.  </strong>If your parent has difficulty opening drawers, cabinets or even the refrigerator door, try placing fabric loops through drawer pulls and door handles.  When your parent is ready to open them he or she can place their hand and arm through the loop and pull with the forearm.

<strong>Use lightweight dishes.  </strong>The stoneware your mother got as a wedding gift may be a little hard to carry now!  Help save her hand joints by getting her some lightweight dishes – plastic works great and won’t break even if it’s dropped.  Better yet, encourage her to use a sturdy paper plate for most meals.  That way, your parent will be spared the cleanup too!

<strong>Look for texture.  </strong>When shopping for glassware or items with handles, look for texture.  Bumpy, rigid, rough or rubberized surfaces are usually easier to grip than slick ones.  The same items can be useful for you as well to prevent slipping and breaking if your hands are wet or you’ve just applied lotion (especially in the bathroom area!).

<strong>Pick easy to open bottles.  </strong>If there are no children in the home, forego the childproof prescription bottles, which can be hard on stiff hands.  Ask the pharmacist to put prescriptions in easy-to-open containers or transfer them yourself to a medication dispenser.  (Note: If children visit, of course, put medications where they can’t be reached by small hands).

<strong>Spare the fingers.</strong> If typing or pressing the buttons on a phone or microwave is difficult, suggest your parent use the eraser end of a pencil to do the job.  If your parent uses a computer for email or letter writing, voice recognition software can enable him or her to compose copy without having to key it in.

<strong>Open up.  </strong>If your parent has difficulty opening plastic or cellophane packages such as the kind crackers, cereal or sandwich meats come in, open the packages yourself and transfer the contents into a “zipable” plastic bag or plastic containers that your parent can open and close easily when he or she is ready to use the product.  For pretzels or chips, open the bag, fold down the top and close it with a chip clip – these are readily available at supermarkets and discount stores.

<strong>Go topless.</strong>  Removing the top from spray deodorant, shaving cream, hair spray and aerosol cleaning products such as bathroom cleaner or furniture polish can be difficult for anyone.  If your parent uses these products, remove the tops and store the cans “topless.”  Another option is to purchase non-aerosol products such as roll-on or stick deodorant, pump hairspray, or pre-treated dusting or disinfecting wipes.  (The latter prevents your parent from having to use extra strength to push down a spray can button!)

<strong>Think small.</strong>  Economy-size jugs of milk, laundry detergent or bottles of dish liquid may cost less than getting the equivalent amount in several smaller containers, but when gripping (and lifting) is a problem, smaller packages may be a better idea.  When shopping for your parent, look for small easy-to-grip containers.  If he or she insists on large packages to save money, transfer the contents to smaller containers when you get the groceries home.

234,"Are YOU Experiencing Memory Loss?????","<div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center"">Even if you’re experiencing a troublesome level of memory loss, there are many things you can do to learn new information and retain it.  The same practices that contribute to healthy aging and physical vitality also contribute to healthy memory.   When it comes to memory, it’s “use it or lose it.”   Just as physical exercise can make and keep your body stronger, mental exercise can make your brain work better and lower the risk of mental decline.  Here are some fantastic tips I've collected from my <strong>expert</strong> colleagues in the field of <strong>LIVING</strong> (not aging)!!!!!!</p>

</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em> <strong>Tips to Help Prevent Memory Loss and Cognitive Decline</strong></em></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exercise Regularly</span></strong>. Regular exercise boosts brain growth factors and encourages the development of new brain cells. Exercise also reduces the risk for disorders that lead to memory loss, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Exercise also makes a huge difference in managing stress and alleviating anxiety and depression—all of which leads to a healthier brain.</li>
	<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Stay Social.</span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span>People who don’t have social contact with family and friends are at higher risk for memory problems than people who have strong social ties. Social interaction helps brain function in several ways: it often involves activities that challenge the mind, and it helps ward off stress and depression. So join a book club, reconnect with old friends, or visit the local senior center. Being with other people will help keep you sharp!</li>
	<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Eat Plenty of Fruits, Vegetables, and Omega-3 Fats.</span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span>Antioxidants, found in abundance in fresh produce, literally keep your brain cells from “rusting.” And foods rich in omega-3 fats (such as salmon, tuna, trout, walnuts, and flaxseed) are particularly good for your brain and memory. Also avoid saturated and trans fats, which helps cholesterol levels and reduces your risk of stroke.</li>
	<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Manage Stress. </span></strong>Cortisol, the stress hormone, damages the brain over time and can lead to memory problems. But even before that happens, stress causes memory difficulties in the moment. When you’re stressed out, you’re more likely to suffer memory lapses and have trouble learning and concentrating.</li>
	<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Get Plenty of Sleep.</span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span>Sleep is necessary for memory consolidation, the process of forming and storing new memories so you can retrieve them later. Sleep deprivation also reduces the growth of new neurons in the hippocampus and causes problems with memory, concentration, and decision-making. It can even lead to depression—another memory killer.</li>
	<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Don’t Smoke. </span></strong>Smoking heightens the risk of vascular disorders that can cause stroke and constrict arteries that deliver oxygen to the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em> <strong>Brain Exercises to Help Prevent Memory Loss &amp; Boost Brainpower</strong></em></p>
Here are some ideas for brain exercise, from light workouts to heavy lifting:
<ul>
	<li>Play games that involve strategy, like chess or bridge, and word games like Scrabble.</li>
	<li>Try crossword and other word puzzles, or number puzzles such as Sudoku.</li>
	<li>Read newspapers, magazines, and books that challenge you.</li>
	<li>Get in the habit of learning new things: games, recipes, driving routes, a musical instrument, a foreign language.</li>
	<li>Take a course in an unfamiliar subject that interests you. The more interested and engaged your brain, the more likely you’ll be to continue learning and the greater the benefits you’ll experience.</li>
	<li>Take on a project that involves design and planning, such as a new garden or a quilt.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p align=""center""><em><strong>When to See a Doctor for Memory Loss</strong></em></p>

</div>
It’s time to consult a doctor when memory lapses become frequent enough or sufficiently noticeable to concern you or a family member. If you get to that point, make an appointment to talk with your primary physician and have a thorough physical examination.  The doctor will ask you a lot of question about your memory, including:
<ul>
	<li>How long you or others have noticed a problem with your memory?</li>
	<li>What kinds of things have been difficult to remember?</li>
	<li>Whether the difficulty came on gradually or suddenly?</li>
	<li>Whether you’re having trouble doing ordinary things?</li>
</ul>
The doctor also will want to know what medications you’re taking, how you’ve been eating and sleeping, whether you’ve been depressed or stressed lately, and other questions about what’s been happening in your life. Chances are the doctor will also ask you or your partner to keep track of your symptoms and check back in a few months.

263,"Great New Gadgets for Boomers","Casey Dowd, the ""boomer reporter"" for www. foxbusiness.com, recently interviewed me for an article about the best new gadgets/technology for baby boomers.

The marketplace for technology to assist aging adults is expected to grow sharply from $2 billion today to more than $20 billion by 2020, according a report from Aging in Place Technology Watch—and boomers are going to be on the receiving end of the advancements and innovations.

<strong>Boomer:  We’ve all seen the old reliable “pill box” our parents used.  Are there other products available to help remind boomers to either take or that they already took their medicine?</strong>

<strong>Abramson</strong>: Baby boomers rely on their medications to keep them healthy, but complex medication schedules can lead to mistakes: missing doses, taking incorrect amounts, or taking medicines at the wrong times. These mistakes could lead to unnecessary doctor or hospital visits, illness and even death.  It’s currently estimated that about one third to one half of baby boomers do not take their medications as prescribed.  With the complexity of medications many seniors take, it's no surprise that 1 in 10 hospital admissions for seniors are a result of medication errors.  A plethora of new products and services have recently been introduced to the market to not only prompt patients to take their medications <em>on</em> <em>time</em> but also in the <em>correct dosages.</em>

<strong>Walgreens Rx App</strong>: Walgreens’ mobile health app called Pill Reminder helps users track their medication and receive alerts. The alerts can be scheduled nine different ways, including daily, hourly, weekly and can hold multiple prescriptions, vitamins and other supplements.

<strong>Alarm Pill Organizer: </strong>This organizer features a reminder alarm to help people take their medicine on time. The pill case is a weekly pillbox with one compartment per day and up to four daily alarms.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Vitality's AT&amp;T connected GlowCaps: </strong>These GlowCaps fit on standard prescription bottles and use light and sound reminders, which can be followed by a phone call or text message, so people don't miss a medication dose. Each time the pill bottle is opened data is recorded and used to compile periodic progress reports that can be relayed to patients, caregivers, doctors and family members.

<strong>The Philips Medication Dispenser</strong>: This electronic voice output medication reminder and dispenser is designed for individuals with vision, memory or cognitive disabilities.  Medications are placed in a one-ounce plastic cup, loaded in the dispenser and administered as scheduled.  Caregivers can also monitor activity through Philips Monitoring report which is always available online.

<strong>Boomer: If an active baby boomer had to choose between purchasing an iPad or a laptop which one would you suggest and why?</strong>

<strong>Abramson</strong>: The iPad is a great choice, especially for mobile baby boomers looking for a user-friendly and lightweight computer to access their email, catch up on the news, search the web and shop. The iPad is easy to carry, store and use. There is also no need for a mouse or any additional devices to be attached. The iPad also allows users to zoom in on text, making it larger and easy to read.  Many boomers find the iPad easy to use and more intuitive than competitors.

Boomers should note that tablets, in general, are mainly content consumption devices rather than work stations. If you plan to type a lot of text or need a device to deliver large scale projects, a tablet may not be the right device.

<strong>Boomer: Which e-book reader would you recommend for boomers?</strong>

Abramson:  As e-readers become more popular, digital book sales continue to climb. In fact, online retail giant Amazon is now selling more e-books than hardcover books and paperback books combined.

According to a recent Pew Research Center report, boomers are a promising demographic for e-readers (and sellers of e-books), since they (specifically older boomers) are the most likely of any age group to make a purchase online.  Boomers are increasingly looking for large-print books, and the ability to change the font size of text on e-readers is very compelling. Additionally, some e-readers have features that give a voice to the words on the page and libraries now offer a free digital-book lending service.

Currently, the Amazon Kindle Fire would be my recommended e-reader tablet for baby boomers - I especially like its crisp, hi-resolution multi-touch color display.  With its $199 price tag, it has to be one of the cheapest tablet PCs running on the Google Android platform. It has a 7-inch screen, Wi-fi support for connectivity, USB ports and is extremely lightweight at 14.5 ounces. The battery life is around eight hours.

<strong>Boomer: What technology is available for boomers that live alone and need to reach help in an emergency?</strong>

Abramson:  New and improved technologies emphasize wellness, mobility, autonomy and social connectivity.   These innovative products and services are promoting health and independence for aging baby boomers.  Here are a few of my favorite examples of new technology in the fall prevention and emergency monitoring space:

<strong>ActiveCare</strong><strong> <strong>Personal Assistant</strong> <strong>Link</strong></strong>: This one-touch system looks like a small cell phone with large buttons. With the push of a button boomers are connected to ActiveCare’s call center with specialists that can help with everything from calling an ambulance to calling a physician or family members. GPS is integral to the PAL system, allowing users’ locations to be tracked at all times, and can detect if an individual has fallen.

<strong>eNeighbor Monitoring System: </strong>This system is programmed to detect unusual activity in the home. A shower left running or a fridge that goes unopened for a day could trigger a phone call to the end user or a caregiver.   <strong> </strong>

<strong>GrandCare: </strong>This system offers a comprehensive communication and monitoring system for active seniors combining aspects of home automation, online communications and healthcare (telehealth) in one flexible and user-friendly package.

<strong>BeClose</strong>: The device tracks your loved one’s daily routine by receiving information from discreet wireless sensors that are placed in various locations around the home (as well as a wearable alert button).  Caregivers have the freedom of knowing their aging loved one is safe because they are able to check on them at any time using a secure, private web page.  If there are any disruptions to daily life, the primary caregiver will be alerted immediately by phone, email or text message.

<strong>Boomer: Are there any electronic devices for boomers who love to travel?</strong>

Abramson:  Baby boomers comprise an increasing share of the nation’s travel.  In fact, according to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, approximately 80% of leisure travel is comprised of baby boomers. Here are a few gadgets that will make your next trip a little less stressful and a lot more enjoyable!

<strong>Polaroid Zink </strong>: This zero ink, 14 megapixel digital camera pops out a bordered and dated photo on the spot. And unlike its ‘60s predecessor, the Z340 keeps a copy in memory so even if you lose the print you never lose the picture.

<strong>The Magellan Maestro 5310: </strong>This portable GPS-based navigation system is specifically geared toward boomers: it features a larger screen and improved readability. Boomers can also use this GPS device to keep tabs on aging parents, especially those with dementia.

<strong>iLuv Dream Traveler: </strong>This innovative product does away with hotel outlet challenges with a slim travel size combo power strip that included surge protection and a USB charger for up to six devices, including laptops, digital cameras, e-book readers, etc.

<strong>Cloud Camera 5000</strong>: This camera lets baby boomers keep an eye on their home while they're away. The camera has a motorized pan and tilt base that you can access and control through the company's<em> </em>interface. Set motion-sensor triggers to email you alerts of any disturbances.

<strong>Boomer: With technology changing daily and new gadgets constantly hitting the market, what three things would you suggest boomers look to purchase that may make their lives easier or more fun?  </strong>

<strong>Abramson</strong>:  Health, leisure activities and socialization are three areas that boomer technology companies are focusing on and will continue to do so as baby boomers reach 65 and beyond.

<strong>Jawbone UP – UP</strong> is the app-powered wrist band that inspires you to feel better and live healthier . It tracks every move you make, and will remind you to move more.  The sky-blue wristband measures activity, sleep and nutrition and downloads all the data collected to an app on your smartphone.  The battery lasts 10 days and even works in water.

<strong>Q i-wear: </strong> These shatterproof sunglasses bring on the music via Bluetooth stereo earbuds while toning down the ambient noise. They also allow you to simultaneously take phone calls through a Blue-tooth enabled device.

<strong>Bionic Relief Grip Golf Gloves</strong>: The anatomical pad system of these gloves offer a  more secure grip with less effort, to reduce pain and hand fatigue for those with arthritis.

461,"Five Legal Documents You Need for Your Parents","These documents will ensure that you can assist your parents in a medical or financial emergency and, at their deaths, ease the distribution of their estate.

<strong>1.   A <strong>MEDICAL DIRECTIVE</strong></strong>
Also known as a living will or advance health care directive, this document sets out what kind of care your parents want to receive if and when they become ill or incapacitated. An advance health care directive is the primary legal tool for protecting a person’s healthcare wishes if and when he can’t speak for himself. The health care directive applies any time the person is unable to communicate, whether or not the situation is life threatening, and for however long is necessary.

<strong>2.   A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTHCARE AND HIPAA RELEASE</strong>
A durable power of attorney for healthcare allows you to make healthcare decisions for your parents. A HIPAA release gives you access to your parents’ health records and physicians.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vquhh9N94M0?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<strong>3.   A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR FINANCES</strong>
A power of attorney for finances is a document that appoints a person — or sometimes an institution such as a bank or trust company — to handle someone’s financial affairs. A power of attorney for finances can also be used to make life easier for your parents, for example, or loved ones even though they still make decisions and handle some financial matters themselves. Or it can be used to handle all their financial matters when they’re incapable of doing so themselves.

<strong>4.   A REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST</strong>
It allows your parents to retain control over their estate while making transfers of assets to beneficiaries. Your parents designate what property (home, investments, jewelry, and so on) goes into the trust and to whom it will be granted. During their lifetimes, your parents act as executors of their own living trust. A revocable living trust has an important advantage: it allows their estate to avoid probate at the time of their deaths.

<strong>5.   A WILL</strong>
A will makes clear who will receive your parents’ assets and personal property. A properly written will helps to avoid disagreements over your parents’ estate after their deaths. Good estate planning is simply making sure that the financial assets that are most important to you and your family – no matter how much or how little — go to the intended recipients as quickly, cheaply, and easily as possible.

<div>When it comes to <a href=""http://www.care.com/adults-seniors"">caring for our aging parents</a>, many of us struggle with feelings of guilt, and those feelings can be greatly amplified by distance. Am I
visiting, calling, doing enough? Sometimes parents can themselves--knowingly or unknowingly -- contribute to these emotions, openly complaining about your absence or sounding pitiful each time you call. A 2009 <a href=""http://www.caregiving.org/data/CaregivingUSAllAgesExecSum.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">National Alliance of Caregiving study</a> found that about 15 percent of <a href=""http://www.care.com/caregiver"">caregivers</a> live more than hour away. Even under the best of circumstances, caregiving is often accompanied by a sense of guilt. Being far away just intensifies those feelings...and the issues involved.</div>
""Caregiving from a distance can be challenging because you're not physically present to care for a loved one on a daily basis, and this can cause feelings of guilt,"" remarks Jill Martinelli, LCSW and <a href=""http://www.care.com/senior-care-planning"">Senior Care Advisor at Care.com</a>. ""However, it's important to understand that it's okay to have these feelings; it's how you address feelings of guilt that will impact your experience as a caregiver.""

<a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr. Alexis Abramson</a>, a nationally recognized expert on aging, television personality, speaker and author of several books including <em><a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/books-dvds.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Caregivers Survival Handbook</a>, <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/books-dvds.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Home Safety for Seniors</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/books-dvds.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The 55+ Fact Book</a></em>, says that ""<strong>caregiver guilt</strong> is very <em>common</em>, and it is extremely destructive, making an already stressful situation even more challenging. It can make you feel tired, weak and immobile""...explains Dr. Abramson, which in turn makes you less effective, not to mention unhappier!

Here's some practical and thoughtful guidance about facing and coping with the guilt that often comes with caregiving from a distance.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Accept</strong>
Recognize that feelings of inadequacy and guilt are normal. Allow yourself to acknowledge these emotions, so that you can process them and let them go. Know what your strengths are as a long distance caregiver, but also accept that there are real limits to what you can do from afar.""No matter how much you already do, there are most likely times when you tell yourself that you could be doing even more,"" said Dr. Abramson. ""Accept these feelings of guilt. Without recognition, guilt can be a debilitating force. Know where these feelings come from and be aware that you're not alone in having such thoughts.""</li>
	<li><strong>Reach Out</strong>
You may not be able to visit your loved one regularly, but call, arrange a video chat, write or find other personal ways to show you care. It will help alleviate any thoughts of guilt that can often drive a deeper wedge between you and your parent.</li>
	<li><strong>Redefine ""Caring""</strong>
While you may not be able to be there physically, recognize that what you can do from a distance does matter. You need to be realistic about what you can do and what is good enough. Work with your parent to identify what you can and cannot do, and find ways to fill the gaps that matter most to mom or dad, by possibly hiring a <a href=""http://www.care.com/senior-care"">senior caregiver</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Reconcile</strong>
If there are old wounds, forgive your parent and seek forgiveness. Maybe dad wasn't home much when you were a child and there's still some lingering hurt. Maybe mom seemed to favor a younger sister, who isn't available to help shoulder caregiving duties. Longstanding resentments and unresolved issues can worsen guilty feelings. Now may be the time to finally set those riffs aside or have a heart-to-heart that focuses on your part of the hurt, knowing that the past can't be undone and that your parent needs you.</li>
	<li><strong>Be Supportive</strong>
If another sibling lives close-by and handles most of the caregiving, your guilt may be multiplied. Perhaps your sibling is resentful of your distance or maybe you truly long to be closer and more helpful. Support the primary caregiver with words of encouragement, a listening ear and financial support if possible. Don't let guilt prevent you from reaching out with loving support.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus on Love, not Duty</strong>
While we do have an obligation to help care for an elderly parent, try to be motivated by love and compassion, rather than by obligation. Caregiving can be a positive experience, as it can redefine a relationship with a parent or strengthen relationships with siblings. It can enhance your feelings of wellbeing and help diffuse feelings of guilt. Reflect on the Golden Rule, and <a href=""http://www.care.com/-p1017-qxid%7C1103041949.html"">treat your parent as you'd like to be treated</a>, which can also be a powerful example for your own kids.</li>
	<li><strong>Inspire Independence</strong>
As your mom or dad age and become dependent on others, they may begin to feel more vulnerable and start doubting their own self-sufficiency. Help alleviate those feelings by <a href=""http://www.care.com/-p1017-qxid%7C0902031811.html"">encouraging your parents to connect with friends</a>, explore new hobbies and enjoy their current life. Let go of any belief that you and your parents' worlds have to be completely intertwined. None of you need that burden. It's genuinely healthy for your parent to make a life for themselves, no matter how old they are, so it's better than okay to let go of the responsibility of being your parent's everything.</li>
	<li><strong>Have Healthy Boundaries</strong>
Your mom, dad, family or friends may say or do things that seem to provoke guilt. Don't engage them. Listen, love and redirect the conversation to a neutral topic.</li>
	<li><strong>Use Supports</strong>
Whether you connect with a Geriatric Care Manager, a religious organization, a nice neighbor or a senior care advisor, there are ways to provide additional care for a loved one from a distance and gain peace of mind. Start by contacting a nearby Area Agency on Aging (AAA) for helpful resources such as meal delivery programs, community outreach, senior centers and public services. You can use <a href=""http://www.eldercare.gov/Eldercare.NET/Public/Index.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Eldercare Locator</a> on Care.com to find your local AAA.  And don't forget to <a href=""http://www.care.com/-p1017-qxid%7C1111040653.html"">take care of you</a>!  Talk with close friends, siblings and other family members about your feelings, find a support group or get professional help if you're overwhelmed.</li>

487,"""Dr. Alexis"" Offers Caregiving Advice","by <a title=""Posts by Mary Shustack"" href=""http://westfaironline.com/author/mary-shustack/"" rel=""author"">Mary Shustack</a>
<div>

Alexis Abramson’s biography is jam-packed with details about her career as a speaker, blogger, corporate consultant, author and award-winning entrepreneur and journalist.

But it was her time as a caregiver – and the insights gleaned during the 10 years she spent tending to the needs of her maternal grandmother – that seemed to resonate most deeply with an audience in White Plains recently.

The gerontology expert, nicknamed Doctor Alexis and nationally known for her work on behalf of baby boomers and mature adults, spoke about “Caring for the Caregiver” during a July 11 presentation at The Kensington, an enhanced assisted living residence on Maple Avenue.

When Abramson, now 45, was in her 20s, she was the primary caregiver for her grandmother, Mimi Rose.

It was a period of great challenges.

“Whenever you’re a paid caregiver or an unpaid caregiver you have some very tough moments,” she said.

But, Abramson added, it was a time of even greater rewards, a period that had an enduring impact on her life and solidified her commitment to her chosen field.

“It was the most incredible time in my life,” Abramson said. “I was so honored.”

Having learned so much both in academic settings – she has a doctorate in gerontology from the University of Southern California’s Davis School of Gerontology – and firsthand, Abramson is dedicated to helping others on their own “caregiving journey.”

And reflective of Abramson’s personality and approach, the presentation combined straightforward advice with a hefty dose of humor. There were not only facts, figures and practical suggestions, but also plenty of funny anecdotes, cartoons, short videos and even a bit of song.

It’s a way to face a most serious problem, Abramson said in a chat before the formal program began.

“I feel very strongly that mature adults have been put out to pasture,” she said.

The Emmy Award-winning journalist, who appeared frequently as an on-air expert gerontologist for NBC’s “Today Show” and “Weekend Today” and has also appeared on CNN, CBS and MSNBC, was quick to reel off facts and figures that show just how important the field of eldercare is.

She says that there are currently more than 65 million caregivers (defined as those who care for an aging loved one) in the United States. Nearly one in four households is involved in caring for a relative or friend who is aged 50 or older. Caregivers, she says, are primarily female (72 percent), mostly wives and adult daughters. The average age of a caregiver is 47. More than one in three, though, are mature adults (65 or older) themselves.

Caregiving can last from less than a year to decades, with 80 percent of caregivers providing at least some type of unpaid assistance seven days a week.

And the need for caregivers, Abramson added, is growing. It’s also estimated that more than 80 million people in this country will have more than two chronic conditions by the year 2020.

There are already growing problems that will impact the number of caregivers who will be available in coming years. A rise in rates of divorce and remarriage, increasing geographic mobility, smaller family sizes, a delay in childbearing and an increase in women in the workplace all contribute to less available help for the aging population, she said.

And it is time, Abramson said, to address the situation: “Otherwise, it’s going to be a catastrophe, an epidemic.”

Abramson, who is based in Manhattan and Atlanta, is involved in most every aspect of eldercare. Just a glimpse of her partial client list shows the breadth of her work, as she has provided services for businesses, events and organizations such as AARP, the Alzheimer’s Association, General Foods, Century 21 Real Estate Corp., the National Association of Television Executives, Senior Olympics and the White House Conference on Aging.

All of her background and training help her make a thoughtful connection with those she addresses at her many speaking engagements.

“I’m here to throw you a lifeline and show you there are some tools,” she said to the audience, as she launched into a presentation that touched on everything from juggling multiple tasks to managing feelings, from how to garner family support to how to communicate effectively with your loved one.

Much of the talk reflected the topics covered in Abramson’s book, “The Caregiver’s Survival Handbook,” written with Mary Anne Dunkin.

As Abramson is often tapped as keynote speaker at industry conferences and helps bring awareness of baby boomer and mature adult issues to corporations, consumers, government agencies and nonprofit groups, she is also sometimes asked to address some very practical needs, from personal-care products to ways to adapt a home.

“I think products need to be taken to another level,” she said. “Manufacturers need to be challenged.”

For many, the topic of aging and eldercare is mired in financial concerns, as well.

“People are making some pretty critical decisions now, whether they’re going to pay for their children’s educations or their parents’ health care,” Abramson says. “Our fountain of youth is finances.”

In the end, she said one of the biggest issues in facing this growing challenge is learning how to deal with the feelings that caregiving prompts, including stress and guilt.

“As caregivers, we can’t turn our feelings on and off,” she said. “There are so many issues and challenges that guilt has become a major problem.”

She hopes that people can learn to provide caregiving in an environment that serves both the needs of the loved one – and the caregiver.

After all, she said, remembering her time with her maternal grandmother, the caregiving experience was one that has been a major part of her life a positive experience, that cannot be replaced. She got to spend quality time and form a bond that she has helped turn into a legacy“I know the stories and I’m going to pass them on.”

511,"Do You Have a Fire Safety Plan?","Ok so the fire alarm went off in our building yesterday (<em>about 100 times - including a nice jolt at 1 am this morning</em>) and we all had to eventually evacuate…Luckily it was simply a malfunction in the system so all is well.  That being said, as my husband and I were slowly making our way down the stairs behind some of our older neighbors I began to wonder if they had an evacuation plan in place….Just at that moment a couple of other folks started running UP the stairs hysterically yelling that they were going to get <em>""so and so""</em> in condo #xxxx so nobody should worry.  But were we worried?  Did we even know that ""so and so"" (<em>at 91 years old!</em>) was living alone in that condo?  Do we even know who might be in a wheelchair in our building?  How about a small child that might need some extra care?  It occurred to me that you can have a ""plan"" (<em>per se</em>) but is it really organized and does it take into consideration all of the potential circumstances?  NO.

So, with that being said, I'm offering a few words of advice below (the extent of my knowledge to date) but I would love it if anyone who is reading this blog (and has actually thought about this topic previously) could provide a resource, blueprint or plan for how we should all move forward to create a ""neighbor to neighbor"" check-in procedure for fires and any other natural disasters that might be headed our way (<em>especially when our older neighbors are involved</em>). <strong> Just leave a comment - I thank you all in advance for your input!</strong><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/u0p23UVTALU?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the meantime, do you have a fire escape plan?  While 66% of Americans have an escape plan in case of a fire, only 35% of those have practiced the plan; and about 70% of adults 55+ claim they don't have any type of escape plan in place. A house fire can spread rapidly through your home or condo, leaving you as little as two minutes to escape safely once the alarm sounds.  It's estimated that one-third of fire injuries experienced by adults 65+ occur as the victim is trying to escape.  Those aged 65+ make up 32% of all fire deaths and 11% of fire injuries.  Older adults’ ability to detect a fire and escape safely may be hindered by decreased mobility, vision, resistance to new technologies and hearing disabilities. Cooking fires are the leading cause of fire injuries among older adults - when using the stove one should never leave cooking food unattended or wear loose sleeves that might dangle over a stove.

Here are some fire safety tips for adults 65+:
<ul>
	<li>Make sure that smoke alarms are installed in every bedroom room and outside sleeping areas</li>
	<li>Test each alarm monthly and replace the battery at least once a year</li>
	<li>Have a telephone installed where you sleep in case of an emergency</li>
	<li>Conduct fire drills to make sure you know what to do in the event of a home or condo fire</li>
	<li>Make sure you are able to open all doors and windows in your home</li>
	<li>Change unsafe smoking habits</li>
	<li>Do not store newspapers, rags or other combustible materials near a furnace, hot water heater or space heater</li>
	<li>If you live in an apartment building, consider sleeping in a room on the ground floor in order to make emergency escape easier</li>
</ul>
<strong>Here are some U.S. fire statistics:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Every <strong>19 seconds </strong>a fire department responds to a fire</li>
	<li>Every <strong>three hours</strong> someone dies in a home fire</li>
	<li><strong>More than half</strong> of all home fire deaths result from incidents reported between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM because people are sleeping and do not hear the alarm</li>
	<li><strong>December</strong> and <strong>January</strong> are the peak months for reported home fires and home fire deaths because of holiday decorations, alcohol consumption, portable heaters and fireplaces</li>
</ul>

513,"Safe Driving Tips for Older Adults","The <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pew Research Center</a> reminds us that 8,000 boomers are turning 65 every day for the next 16 years. By 2030, they'll represent almost one in five drivers. Safe driving is an important issue for everyone - especially seniors! Although older drivers are at a <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/10/teenagers-and-older-people-are-the-riskiest-drivers/index.htm"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">higher risk</a> of becoming involved in an automobile accident than younger drivers, not everyone is an ""accident waiting to happen"" - and in fact many seniors are better drivers than today's young folks.

The United States has unfortunately created a culture where in most situations we are forced to drive, and we embrace it. We use our cars to get our basic necessities, participate in social events and ""the automobile"" is often considered to be the cornerstone of American independence. Most people would drive from their bed to the fridge if they could!!! I recently wrote a blog about <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/livable-communities/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">livable communities</a> that are specifically developed to reduce the amount of driving as we age by making public transportation, social activities, parks and recreation more convenient - hopefully this trend is on the rise as the graying of America becomes more imminent.

We all age at different rates and with different needs. This is important to keep in mind because periodically we must check for those symptoms and outside causes that may impact our loved one's ability to drive safely. Seniors are more likely to receive traffic citations when it comes to small things such as failing to yield, turning improperly and running stop signs. These types of incidents may be early signs of decreased driving ability. Research tells us that automotive collisions become significantly <a href=""http://www.iihs.org/research/qanda/older_people.aspx"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">more deadly</a> after a driver has reached the age of 70. The good thing is that in today's world there's plenty of information to help better educate caregivers and their aging loved one's so that we can hopefully avoid this problem.

If you feel you need to have a conversation about safe driving with an aging loved one it's important to be delicate in your approach. The <a href=""http://seniordriving.aaa.com/evaluate-your-driving-ability"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">AAA online senior drivers quiz</a> discusses common risk factors and instructs readers as to how to avoid potentially dangerous driving habits or behaviors - this is a good place to start. Here are some warning signs <a href=""http://www.aarp.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">AARP</a> considers to be the most important indicators as to when someone should begin to limit driving or stop driving all together....

• Feeling uncomfortable and nervous or fearful while driving
• Dents and scrapes on the car or on fences, mailboxes, garage doors, curbs etc.
• Difficulty staying in the lane of travel
• Getting lost
• Trouble paying attention to signals, road signs and pavement markings
• Slower response rates to unexpected situations
• Medical conditions/medications that may be affecting the ability to handle the car safely
• Frequent ""close calls"" (i.e. almost crashing)
• Trouble judging gaps in traffic at intersections and on highway entrance/exit ramps
• Other drivers honking at you and instances when you are angry at other drivers
• Friends or relatives not wanting to drive with you
• Difficulty seeing the sides of the road when looking straight ahead
• Being easily distracted or having a hard time concentrating while driving
• Difficulty turning around to check over your shoulder while backing up or changing lanes
• Frequent traffic tickets or ""warnings"" by traffic or law enforcement officers

If some of these signs seem to be a concern for you or an aging loved one you might want to consider consulting a doctor or a professional in the field. Stay safe. Care for your safety and others.",,"2020-11-20 01:07:32",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/safe-driving-tips-for-seniors/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/11_xc90_frt.jpg,"seniors driving","tips for senior citizens for safe driving",,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/11_xc90_frt.jpg,,Longevity,,,4,86,none,,,,79,2937,,"safe driving tips for seniors","Safe driving tips for seniors: Know the risks - Dr. Alexis","When it comes to safe driving tips for seniors, an important point is to carefully monitor the situation.

527,"Tips to Simplify Medicare Plan D","It's that time again!  Medicare’s open-enrollment period runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. During this time frame, beneficiaries can move between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans. (In the latter, participants receive Medicare benefits through private health plans, such as health maintenance organizations.) At the same time, beneficiaries are able to choose or change Medicare Advantage plans and Part D drug plans.

My colleagues at the website grandparents.com were kind enough to interview me recently regarding Medicare Part D Open Enrollment ....Below is an abbreviated version of the article/blog....These expert tips will help you work your way through the Medicare maze to find the plan that's right for you...

<strong>By Deborah Long</strong><div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTxWUlecB_k?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Every year we have the option to update our Medicare Part D plan during open enrollment.  If you haven’t finalized your decision for the Plan D coverage that will cover your prescriptions because you find the process overwhelming, you’re not alone. But taking the time to figure out which plan is for you, can save you hundreds of dollars. We went to Dr. Alexis Abramson, Ph.D., a leading advocate for senior health and wellness issues, for her best tips on how to pick the right plan for you.

<strong>Tip #1: Remember to Enroll for Part D</strong>
“It seems so obvious, I know, but my first piece of advice to folks is to be sure you enroll. There still are people who think enrollment is automatic, and while in some cases that may be true for Medicare Parts A and B, it is never true for Medicare Part D,” says Dr. Abramson.

<strong>Tip #2: Know What’s New</strong>
“Each year, plan premiums, deductibles, prescription copayments and annual out-of-pocket expenses can change.  To choose the most cost-effective plan for you, map out all these elements to calculate the total cost of the plan. And don’t forget to factor in what’s new for you personally, too.  If you’re traveling more, or you’ve moved, or have new prescriptions, be sure to take those things into consideration when you select your plan.”

<strong>Tip #3: Ask for Help</strong>
“Selecting the right plan can improve your coverage and help save you money, but the process can be overwhelming. Most pharmacists take their role as trusted advisors seriously, so don’t be afraid to ask for their advice on the best plan for you. They’re well-versed in the options available, have a thorough understanding of the process and are also medication experts.”

<strong>Tip #4: Use a Plan Finder</strong>
""Online search tools are your friends! They’re great for helping you sift through all the options out there to find the most cost-effective plan and they’re easy to use,"" says Dr. Abramson. ""You enter basic information, like your zip code and the medications you take, and the system will compare all the available plans for you. Medicare has one, as do other companies, like Walmart.

<strong>Tip #5: Understand the Importance of Preferred Pharmacies</strong>
On a final note, Dr. Abramson encourages you to understand the significance of Preferred Pharmacies. “A pharmacy accepted as “preferred” by a Medicare Part D Plan is a network pharmacy that offers covered drugs to plan members at lower out-of-pocket costs than what the member would pay at a non-preferred network pharmacy. This can make huge difference in what you’ll pay.”",,"2020-10-14 13:30:10",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/guide-to-medicare/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/medicare-.jpg,medicare,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/medicare-.jpg,,Caregiving|Longevity,,"abramson|advantage plans|cost-effective plan|d plan|enrollment|find|health|help|medicare|medicare advantage|medicare advantage plans|network pharmacy|open enrollment|plan|plans|preferred pharmacies|right plan|time|tip|true for medicare",4,86,,,,,67,3373,expert-tips-to-simplify-open-enrollment-for-medicare-plan-d,"guide to medicare","Simplifying Medicare - a guide to medicare by Dr. Alexis Abramson","It's important to keep up with what's the latest in medicare.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Have baby boomers, who made skiing popular in the 1960s and 1970s, reached their demographic peak on the slopes? After all, what person over 50 wants to wait in long lines and risk breaking a bone only to feel as unsteady as a toddler on ice skates?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">But many ski resorts -- recognizing the reservations baby boomers may have about their slower reflexes, aching joints and declining strength -- are seeking to win back the affection of the age group that built the industry. They are rolling out ski programs designed specifically for post 50s, as well as <a href=""http://www.windhammountain.com/events-activities/events-calendar/details/?task=details&amp;last_task=upcoming_events&amp;start_date=2011-09-28&amp;event_eid=2010121609391096"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">après ski locales featuring music for boomers</a> (Woodstock anyone?) and even wellness events designed to teach healthy eating and physical conditioning.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">""I don't think you're ever too old to ski. Maybe there is a point where you need to stop, but I've kept skiing throughout my 50s and have enjoyed it immensely,"" said John Hurlock, an accountant in New York City. ""It can be a bit intimidating when young kids are flying by you, but I try to go when it's not so crowded and to resorts that aren't so crowded.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""http://www.keystoneresort.com/explore-keystone/explorekeystone.aspx"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Colorado's Keystone Resort, </a>for example, has developed a guided ski program for guests 50 and over that's complimentary so long as you have a lift ticket or season pass. You can explore the terrain while enjoying the company of other boomers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Afterwards you can let their hair down at the<a href=""http://www.keystoneresort.com/faqdetail/Dining-and-Nightlife/What-kind-of-bars-and-clubs-does-Keystone-have.axd"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> Last Lift Bar</a> at the Mountain House base area, perfect for midlifers with its vast seating area and regular performances by a swing band on weekends.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">""Keystone is an incredibly accessible and friendly mountain full of pristinely groomed runs perfect for the 50-plus crowd,"" said Tucker Burton, Keystone's communications coordinator. ""Most of our parking is free and exceptionally close to the lifts.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Besides Keystone, many resorts also report focusing more on their grooming to appeal to <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9917842/ns/business-us_business/t/ski-resorts-expand-grooming-aging-boomers/#.UKupY-Oe86w"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">older skiers</a>. In the past, resorts typically concentrated on beginning and intermediate runs, smoothing out bumps while leaving behind areas with distinctive grooves dubbed ""corduroy."" In general, boomers prefer corduroy as it allows them to tackle steeper mountains without putting as much of a strain on their bodies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""http://www.windhammountain.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Windham Mountain Ski Resort in New York</a> said it has built great loyalty from older skiers through its Senior Program that begins every January and runs for eight Tuesdays, with four hours of lessons each session.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">""Each session begins with a yoga program for those who want to partake, plus we have various guest speakers address the participants over the eight weeks,"" said Beth Berry, a spokesperson for the program.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">One full program lesson and single day lift starts at $75 and an eight-week session including instruction and midweek non-holiday season pass is $375. Other pricing options include a Senior Pass for those 65 and over for $369 with no blackout dates and free season passes for those 75 and over.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In addition, Berry said boomers can enjoy free live music and drink specials every Saturday evening at Legends Lounge where themed weekends are tied in with great bands.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A boomer favorite is the annual Woodstock Weekend -- coming up on February 9, 2013 -- that transports guests to 1969 with live music from the era.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">""More than one-third of our guests fit into this demographic group and though we have a reputation as a family-friendly resort close to the New York metro area, we have found great loyalty with the baby boomer generation,"" Berry said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Julia Littman at<a href=""http://www.beavercreek.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> the Beaver Creek Mountain Resort in Colorado</a> said the resort seeks to draw boomers not only with great ski programs, but also with themed weekends such as the Beaver Creek Food &amp; Wine Weekend coming up January 24, 2013, which includes interactive events and seminars while showcasing the culinary talents of well-known area chefs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Another themed event -- the Wellness Weekend starting December 6 -- features health experts, physical conditioning classes, ski instruction and healthy eating seminars.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yet an additional program designed with midlifers in mind is<a href=""http://www.bumpsforboomers.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> Bumps For Boomers in Aspen </a>that teaches those over 50 how to tackle moguls and powder with ease -- and without end-of-the-day aches and pains. Now in its 10th season, the program asks that boomer skiers start out on short skis so that they can relearn how to balance their weight.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""http://articles.courant.com/2012-11-18/travel/hc-ski-redesigns-1118-20121118_1_ski-and-snowboard-tip-and-tail-mohawk-mountain-ski-area"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Short skis</a> are the older skier's new best friend. Indeed, many resorts catering to baby boomers are offering skis that are shorter and wider, with a new design change that helps keep ski tips above the snow. The advent of these skis has helped make skiing accessible again to post 50s who've been away from the sport for several years.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">All the marketing to boomers seems to be paying off as the<a href=""http://www.nsaa.org/nsaa/home/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> National Ski Areas Association </a>reports an 11 percent increase in <a href=""http://www.wtop.com/41/2689403/Baby-boomers-make-a-comeback-on-the-ski-slopes"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">skiing and snowboarding for people 45 and older</a>.

541,"Say Goodbye to Caregiver Guilt","[embed]https://vimeo.com/203709187[/embed]

The daily stress a caregiver endures can be devastating, especially if you’re considered to be the primary caregiver in the family and have limited time due to your job and/or other family responsibilities. The most common feeling “primary” family caregivers have toward aging loved ones is guilt. Guilt can be destructive, making one feel tired, weak and immobile.

No matter how much you already do, there are most likely times when you tell yourself that you could do better. Accept these feelings of guilt. Without recognition, guilt can be a destructive force. Know where these feelings come from and be aware that you are not alone in having such thoughts. The following tips will guide you on your way to saying goodbye to caregiver guilt.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>10 Tips To Help You Say Goodbye To Caregiver Guilt</strong></p>

<ol>
 	<li><strong>Acknowledge your feelings.</strong> Negative feelings can make us feel uneasy and agitated, but it’s important to understand that feelings of anger and resentment are not uncommon if you’re a caregiver. Unless these feelings control us, and our behavior toward our family members, we must learn to accept them.</li>
 	<li><strong>Think quality, not quantity.</strong> If you’re feeling guilty that you aren’t spending enough time with your aging loved ones, think of how you can improve the quality of your time together. Spending time reminiscing with your mother or playing a game of checkers with your father, for example, may mean more to them than cleaning their kitchen or delivering a pot roast.</li>
 	<li><strong>Establish priorities.</strong> While no one has the time or energy to do everything for everybody, you must find time (and energy) to do the things that are most important to you. By establishing priorities - and allowing some flexibility for the unexpected - you can help ensure that the most important needs are met and the most important tasks get done.</li>
 	<li><strong>Set limits.</strong> If your loved ones constant demands are running you ragged decide - and clearly acknowledge - what you’re able and willing to do for them. By setting limits and standing behind them, you can help reduce the guilt trips that come when you can’t meet their every demand.</li>
 	<li><strong>Redefine your concept of caring.</strong> If you find it difficult to provide loving, ‘hands-on’ care for your parent, don’t feel guilty – simply think of other tangible ways you can help in providing for their care.  Perhaps you’re more comfortable chipping in to pay for an outside caregiver or planting flowers so your aging loved one can see them from their bedroom.  We all ‘give care’ differently - add value where you can make a difference.</li>
 	<li><strong>Act from love, not from a sense of debt.</strong> If you think of caring for an aging loved one as repayment for all she’s done for you, you’ll always end up in the red. Instead, think of caregiving as one person helping another out of love.</li>
 	<li><strong>Forgive and seek forgiveness.</strong> If your parent was unkind or uncaring when you were a child, now is the time to forgive – even if you truly feel he or she doesn’t deserve it. Holding grudges will not only affect your ability to care for your parent, but it will also hurt you.</li>
 	<li><strong>Foster their independence.</strong> Don’t feel guilty for not doing things for your loved one that they could be doing for themselves. Instead, look for ways to help them do what they can. Something as simple as a $1.29 pill dispenser can help your parent become more independent - and can free up precious time for you.</li>
 	<li><strong>Face the facts.</strong> Despite how much you want to help, sometimes your aging relative needs round-the-clock care and constant supervision that you can’t provide. When that happens, acknowledge that someone (or some place) may be better equipped to provide the majority of your parent’s care than you are.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t succumb to peer pressure.</strong> Acknowledge, but don’t be unduly influenced by, the advice you get from friends and coworkers. Do what your heart tells you is best and what your circumstances permit.</li>

542,"Tips for Caregivers to Avoid Conflicts with Their Parents","You can’t eliminate all disagreements and uncomfortable situations with your parents, but you can often resolve conflicts and make your relationships run more smoothly, if you just know how!  The following ten tips will help you avoid butting heads with your aging loved ones.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Start early.  </strong>There are some issues that almost all caregivers or would-be caregivers will face at some point, including changing living arrangements, drawing up a will or giving up driving, etc.  If they haven’t arisen yet, discussing them with your older family member before decisions must be made can be a lot less stressful.</li>
	<li><strong>Pick your battles.  </strong>As a caregiver, you will most likely encounter situations where you have to override your parent’s wish to keep them safe and well.  But do so only when necessary!  If your father wants to drive his car after his license has been revoked, for example, it’s your responsibility to stop him.  If he wants to wear red plaid pants with a blue striped shirt or put up his Christmas tree in August, let it slide.</li>
	<li><strong>Enlist the help of professionals.  </strong>Even though you may be closer to your aging loved one than anyone else, that doesn’t mean you have to be the bearer of all bad news.  If you think your Mom needs to see a psychiatrist or trade in her high-heel pumps for safer shoes it might make sense to have a trusted doctor broach the subject with her.</li>
	<li><strong>Let your parents live in their own world.  </strong>If your father’s college football stories or your mother’s insistence that she’s never met your husband (despite the fact that she’s known him for thirty years) drives you up a wall, don’t let on.  How many times has your child or best friend told you the same story over and over?  Try acting amazed when you hear about that wining touchdown for the thousandth’ time or tell your mother that you’d love to introduce her to your husband (just make sure you let him in on the role playing!).</li>
	<li><strong>Don’t make assumptions.  </strong>If you need to make a decision regarding your loved one’s care, don’t always assume you know what’s best for them.  One article I read recently said that most caregivers thought their parent would be better off moving in with them, while most older adults said they would prefer to stay in their own homes or live in an assisted-living facility. If your parent is cognitively and mentally able to participate in decisions regarding their own care, by all means ask for their input.</li>
	<li><strong>Consider your parent’s feelings.  </strong>It’s not easy getting old.  If you look at things from your parent’s perspective – and consider that you will most likely be in their situation one day – you’ll realize it’s smarter to let go of past grudges that might lead to conflict and simply forgive.</li>
	<li><strong>Allow your parent to call the shots – sometimes.  </strong>Many of the challenges that arise in caregiving come when parents feel they are no longer useful or in control.  As with parenting your own child, it’s important to give your parents some power in the family – particularly if he or she lives in your home with you.  If possible, allow them to plan meals, or pick TV shows or family activities now and then.</li>
	<li><strong>Use positive reinforcement.  </strong>It’s easy to criticize when things aren’t going well, especially when you’re overwhelmed and exhausted.  But instead of complaining when things go wrong, try praising your parent when things go right.  Chances are your parent wants to please you and will appreciate the encouragement.</li>
	<li><strong>Foster your parent’s independence.  </strong>Some older adults sit back and prefer to be waited on.  But many would much rather do things themselves – if they can.  By allowing your parents to do the tasks they are physically able to do you will help boost their self-esteem and maintain their independence.</li>
	<li> <strong>Reconsider your arrangements.  </strong>If constant conflicts with your parents are having a negative impact on your health and your family, you may have no choice but to make other arrangements for their care.  If he or she is living in your house, perhaps they could live with another family member or move into an assisted-living home.  If you’re providing most of the care - perhaps another family member could take over some of the duties.</li>

The size and buying power of the Baby Boomer and Senior demographics are staggering, but many companies mistakenly vastly underestimate the viability of today’s mature adults.  Consider these eye opening statistics:

I received quite a response when I recently posted a list of <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/senior-discounts-for-all/"">awesome discounts for 50+</a> consumers on my <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com"">website</a> and it got me thinking about what other trends businesses need to adopt in order to make their products and services baby boomer and senior friendly. Advertisers might still be obsessed with the 18-35 set, but the senior population is one of the fastest growing demographics in America. If you want to see a boost in your business and stay ahead of the game, then you absolutely need to cater to this segment of the population.

<strong>The Market is Trending Towards Baby Boomers</strong>

One example that I’ve used in the past is <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/best-ski-resorts-for-senior-skiers-and-boomers/"">ski resorts for senior skiers and boomers</a>, but it certainly doesn’t stop there. In addition to providing products and services that are targeted to mature adults, you also need to invest in advertising that appeals directly to this demographic. I thought the Dodge <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKKlqMs19tU"">Super Bowl commercial</a> this year was awesome.  I love how Dodge released a statement saying, ""You call it attitude, we call it character. Sometimes in order to get the most out of life you need to keep your eyes open and your mouth shut - we are dropping 100 years' worth of wisdom on our official 2015 Super Bowl commercial""- brilliant marketing and clearly it's about time we showcased our elders in a respectful manner!  Super Bowl commercials are often considered one of the biggest market indicators in terms of where the consumer mindset is headed, so if they’re targeting baby boomers and seniors with their marketing, then you should be too!

<strong>The Buying Power of Women Baby Boomers</strong>

Need more convincing?  Think about the largest segment within the 50+ population - women.  Women not only wield enormous purchasing power since they make the major decisions in their households, but according to “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814473903"">BOOM: Marketing to the Ultimate Power Consumer -- The Baby-Boomer Woman</a>,” this group accounts for 80% of the consumer goods market. I have NO idea why businesses don’t seem to care that women age 50 and older control a <a href=""http://www.she-conomy.com/facts-on-women"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">net worth</a> of $19 trillion and own/control between two-thirds and three-fourths of the nation’s financial wealth. These ladies are also expected to be the beneficiaries of the largest transfer of wealth in our country’s history, in part due to double inheritances from parents and husbands.  Still can't figure out why that’s significant? Ok here's another tid bit of information, despite the 2008 recession, baby boomer spending was up an astonishing <em>45%</em> as compared to the previous ten years, that’s why!  <em><strong>HELLO??!!??</strong></em>

<strong>Baby Boomers and the Family </strong>

Of course, that doesn’t mean that mature adults spend their money willy nilly.  In fact, boomers and seniors are more concerned than ever about their futures and their family’s future, as evidenced by an insightful post on Forbes about how <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/09/12/baby-boomers-spending-less-on-frills-retirement-still-at-risk/"">baby boomers are starting to spend less on frills</a>.  Family is self-reported as being ""one of the highest priorities"" among the 50+, so services and products that cater to those emotional ties and feelings will resonate with them - especially since <a href=""https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/mmi-pressroom/mmi-grandparents-study-pr.pdf"">grandparents are providing more financial support to their grandchildren</a> than ever before.  In fact, a recent <a href=""http://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/general/2012/Insights-and-Spending-Habits-of-Modern-Grandparents-AARP.pdf"">AARP study </a>reported that grandparents say they regularly contribute to several major expenses: 53% to education costs; 37% to everyday living expenses; 23% to medical or dental bills.  Financial institutions seem to have recently woken up and some are capitalizing on this trend by providing retirement and pension plans that older adults can pay into, or manage, for their loved ones.  For instance, to help your grandkids build a nest egg with a Roth IRA, they need earned income, whether it's money from selling lemonade or hours of babysitting. ""Roth IRAs can be a fabulous tax-free growth opportunity for grandchildren because they are investing early and investing young,"" says James Lange, author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Retire-Secure-Taxes-Making-Edition/dp/0470405317"">Retire Secure!: Pay Taxes Later</a>.  Targeted services like these are definitely the key when it comes to appealing to maturing parents and grandparents.

<strong>It’s Time to Focus on Baby Boomers!</strong>

As you can see, the 50+ population is still a swiftly developing consumer market, and it’s hitting an all time high in terms of global aging. While catering to baby boomers and seniors may not necessarily fit into every business’s products and services portfolio, these examples show that this segment is definitely a demographic that deserves closer attention from you and your business. I think you’ll be surprised at how well boomers and seniors will respond to your company if you just take the time to make it baby boomer and senior friendly with products and services specifically geared toward them.  Companies who ignore the 50+ do so at their own peril. All business entities must recognize that as Americans are aging they are accumulating wealth, and their spending power is growing at a pace that’s leaving younger generations far behind.  Any company that has a service or product that might appeal to the 50+ consumer but doesn’t have a strategy for making their offering relevant to this group needs to be prepared for a rough ride over the next twenty years.

Of course, that doesn’t mean that mature adults spend their money willy nilly.  In fact, boomers and seniors are more concerned than ever about their futures and their family’s future, as evidenced by an insightful post on Forbes about how <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/09/12/baby-boomers-spending-less-on-frills-retirement-still-at-risk/"">baby boomers are starting to spend less on frills</a>.  Family is self-reported as being ""one of the highest priorities"" among the 50+, so services and products that cater to those emotional ties and feelings will resonate with them - especially since <a href=""https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/mmi-pressroom/mmi-grandparents-study-pr.pdf"">grandparents are providing more financial support to their grandchildren</a> than ever before.  In fact, a recent <a href=""http://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/general/2012/Insights-and-Spending-Habits-of-Modern-Grandparents-AARP.pdf"">AARP study </a>reported that grandparents say they regularly contribute to several major expenses: 53% to education costs; 37% to everyday living expenses; 23% to medical or dental bills.  Financial institutions seem to have recently woken up and some are capitalizing on this trend by providing retirement and pension plans that older adults can pay into, or manage, for their loved ones.  For instance, to help your grandkids build a nest egg with a Roth IRA, they need earned income, whether it's money from selling lemonade or hours of babysitting. ""Roth IRAs can be a fabulous tax-free growth opportunity for grandchildren because they are investing early and investing young,"" says James Lange, author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Retire-Secure-Taxes-Making-Edition/dp/0470405317"">Retire Secure!: Pay Taxes Later</a>.  Targeted services like these are definitely the key when it comes to appealing to maturing parents and grandparents.

<strong>It’s Time to Focus on Baby Boomers!</strong>

As you can see, the 50+ population is still a swiftly developing consumer market, and it’s hitting an all time high in terms of global aging. While catering to baby boomers and seniors may not necessarily fit into every business’s products and services portfolio, these examples show that this segment is definitely a demographic that deserves closer attention from you and your business. I think you’ll be surprised at how well boomers and seniors will respond to your company if you just take the time to make it baby boomer and senior friendly with products and services specifically geared toward them.  Companies who ignore the 50+ do so at their own peril. All business entities must recognize that as Americans are aging they are accumulating wealth, and their spending power is growing at a pace that’s leaving younger generations far behind.  Any company that has a service or product that might appeal to the 50+ consumer but doesn’t have a strategy for making their offering relevant to this group needs to be prepared for a rough ride over the next twenty years.

556,"Do Male Caregivers Face Workplace Discrimination?","She runs herself ragged caring for her house and kids, spends her lunch hours running errands for her aging parents, and on the rare occasion that she takes some time for herself, she may run by the salon for a quick mani/pedi! If this is how you picture a family caregiver, you're not alone. But your picture's not completely accurate either. According to a <a href=""http://pewinternet.org/~/media/Files/Reports/2012/PIP_Family_Caregivers_Online.pdf"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2012 analysis by the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project</a>, 45 percent of family caregivers in the U.S. are now MEN.

Many male caregivers choose to be stay-at-home dads; some others have lost their jobs and become caregivers by default. But increasingly men are being thrust into (or welcoming) the role of caregiver - for their children and/or aging parents - while working full-time jobs. And those male caregivers may unfortunately face a tougher time than women from employers who are used to caregivers being, <em>well</em>, women!

Male caregivers are more likely to be victims of ""caregiver stigma"" as caregiving is associated with feminine traits, which, as we know, are not always valued in the workplace. Sadly a man who requests time off to take his elderly mother to a doctor's appointment might just as well be announcing plans to attend a retreat ""to get in touch with his feminine side."" That's the bad news.

The good news is that many men are<strong> STEPPING UP t</strong>o do something about caregiver discrimination. According to the <a href=""http://worklifelaw.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Center for WorkLife Law</a> roughly 12 percent of lawsuits alleging family responsibilities discrimination in the workplace are filed by men; between 2006 and 2010, the number of cases brought by male plaintiffs was <em>three times</em> higher than the number filed by men during the previous five-year period.

More good news is that as more men become caregivers, and are subsequently more vocal about the need for caregiver benefits and flexibility, caregiving will no longer be considered a woman's issue - which we we all know it isn't. As the population ages and retirement age increases, greater numbers of working Americans - many of them men -- will be caring for aging family members. Having policies and benefits in place will help both male and female employees as well as employers wishing to retain their most experienced and valuable human resources.

In the meantime, there are things both men and women can do to promote a culture of caregiving in the workplace:

• <strong>Find out what's available.</strong> Ask if your employer offers any type of eldercare employee assistance plan. If so, find out what's available and how to use it. Many employers claim that they offer eldercare services but, according to them, their employees often don't take advantage of these benefits.

• <strong>Form a coalition. </strong>If you work at a fair size company in all likelihood you're not the only man with caregiving responsibilities. Form a coalition with like-minded coworkers (women, too!) and make a case for your employer to add benefits. (Keep in mind that benefits such as flextime, flexible spending accounts, job sharing, and even casual dress days are valuable to all employees, not just caregivers.)

• <strong>Meet informally. </strong>Even if your employer doesn't provide, or agree to provide eldercare benefits, there are things you can do in the workplace informally. I've talked to many men and women who have formed networks with fellow caregivers to share information, meet for lunchtime support groups or cover for each other when one has to be off for caregiving duties.

Another option, of course, is to job hunt. If you're looking to make a job move, make sure you comprehensively review your potential employers' eldercare benefits package first.

558,"Caregiving Expenses Can Pay Off at Tax Time","Caring for an elderly parent can be a pricey proposition, costing the average family caregiver at least $5,500 per year in out of pocket caregiving expenses. But you may find a little help this time of year from a source you may least expect: the IRS.

Whether you're procrastinating filing your returns because you think you'll owe money or caregiving duties haven't left you time to meet with your accountant, consider yourself lucky just this once. That means there's still time for you to claim caregiving expenses on your 2012 tax returns, which could take a bite out of your tax bill this year.
Here are some areas where paying for a parent's care may pay off.

<strong>Dependent Deduction </strong>
If your parent's gross income, excluding Social Security, is less than $3,700 and you paid for more than half of your parent's expenses in 2012, you may be able to claim your parent as a dependent - just as you would claim yourself, your spouse and your children. If your parent qualifies as a dependent (s<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_2012_publink1000220939"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ee IRS Publication 501 to find out</a>), this will reduce your taxable income by $3,700.

<strong>Caregiving Expenses</strong>
Even if you aren't able to claim your parent as a dependent you still may be able to deduct some of the expenses you paid for your parent's care. For example, if you pay someone to care for your disabled parent while you work, you may receive a credit for up to 35 percent of what you paid to a maximum of $3,000 - which translates to a credit of up to $1,050. See IRS Publication 501 for qualifications for the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_2012_publink1000220939"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Child and Dependent Care Credit</a>.

<strong>Medical costs </strong>
If you helped with your parent's medical costs - including prescription medications, hospitalizations, dental and/or vision expenses -- in 2012, you may be able to claim a portion of those costs as a tax deduction. Under IRS rules, you deduct any portion of medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (""AGI""). So, for example, if your family's AGI was $100,000, you can deduct the portion of medical expenses in excess of $10,000. But keep in mind that $10,000 is not just for an elderly parent, but for you and all of your dependents. So, the $3,000 you spent for your teenager's braces or the $1,000 you paid for a root canal also count toward the total. For a list of deductible medical expenses, see IRS Publication 502:<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/uac/Publication-502,-Medical-and-Dental-Expenses-1"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> Medical and Dental Expenses</a>.

In the event that you don't have enough medical expenses to deduct, in some cases you may be able to use your flexible spending account, if you have one, to pay your parent's medical expenses with pre-tax dollars. Be aware that the limit for flexible spending accounts is $2,500 this year. You can spend your flexible spending account on any medical expenses listed in IRS Publication 502 as well as over-the-counter medications prescribed by your - or your parent's - doctor.

<strong>State Tax Deductions</strong>
In addition to the Federal income tax credits and deductions, you may also receive tax breaks on your state income tax, typically in the form of a tax credit that will reduce your AGI - and thus the money you pay in taxes. Your tax advisor can tell you about any programs available in your state.

If you've already filed for 2012, keep these ideas in mind for next year. Be sure to check for any changes in the tax laws, and also be sure to keep good records. You'll need to be able to document what you've spent and where. Hope this helps!

Who hasn't fantasized about retirement? No more time clocks to punch, early-morning alarm clocks to set, rush hour traffic to fight, or uncomfortable heels or cranky early morning kids to deal with? Nothing but leisurely days to travel, enjoy your family or do whatever you wish.

For many Americans, unfortunately, reality doesn't match fantasy, and a life of retirement isn't necessarily a life of bliss. Particularly for men, retirement can lead to feelings of isolation, depression or low-esteem as their identity as the provider for the family changes. A lack of funds can make frequent travel difficult or off limits. Couples who have stuck together through decades of work and child-rearing may find their marriages suffer too when one spouse is suddenly around&nbsp;<strong>ALL THE TIME</strong>!<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YS3BIQhBvK8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Like marriage, a new job, the birth of a child or any other major life change, a successful retirement requires - dare I say it? -&nbsp;<strong>work</strong>! Whether you've been eagerly awaiting retirement or have unexpectedly found yourself there due to a job loss, it's time to get to work making the most of this new phase of life.

Here are some tips that will help ""jumpstart"" your life after retirement.

1. <strong>Don't quit cold turkey.</strong>&nbsp;One day you're working 9 to 5, the next day you're at loose ends wondering how you will spend your day. If you're approaching retirement and not sure whether you want to quit work abruptly, inquire with your supervisor or human resources department about the possibility of working part time or in a consultant role - or perhaps look for a different part-time job to keep you active and supplement your retirement income. One caveat: If you're counting on Social Security to fund your retirement, find out how a paying ""part-time"" job might affect your&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/10069.html"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Social Security retirement benefits</a>.

2. <strong>Do lunch.</strong>&nbsp;Just because you've retired doesn't mean your friends and co-workers have as well. If you had friends you enjoyed working and socializing with, go back to visit occasionally or make plans to meet them for lunch. Doing so will give you something to look forward to and help you keep up with the people with whom you once spent a good part your life.

3. <strong>Keep a schedule.&nbsp;</strong>If you're not a morning person, there's no reason to keep your alarm set at 6 a.m., but sleeping the day away or living without some structure can be demoralizing. Establish some rituals and make a point of keeping a schedule. Try to awaken at the same time each day, plan regular mealtimes and schedule times for other activities such as exercise, housework, social outings or errands.

4. <strong>Get dressed</strong>. No, you don't need to ""dress to the nines"" again - at least not on a daily basis - but you also don't need to spend your days in a fuzzy robe or sweats. Whether you have somewhere to go or not, just getting dressed gives you the sense that there's work to be done, fun to be had, opportunities waiting. If those opportunities arise-- even if it's just answering the door to sign for a FedEx package--you'll be dressed and ready.&nbsp;<strong>ALWAYS</strong>&nbsp;expect the unexpected!

5. <strong>Volunteer</strong>. You've gained a lifetime of skills and experience that you can use to help others in a myriad ways. Find an organization with a mission about which you are passionate - working with animals, tutoring at-risk kids, delivering meals to homebound seniors. Not sure where you'd like to volunteer?&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.seniorcorps.gov/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Senior Corp</a>&nbsp;lets you search for volunteer opportunities by area of interest and zip code. Just do it!

6. <strong>Go back to school</strong>. If you've ever thought of going back to school but didn't have the time or money, now's your chance. During retirement you will have the time and at many colleges and universities you won't need much - if any - money to audit classes, or in some cases, even pursue credit toward a degree. According to a&nbsp;<a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/articles/2009/04/20/forget-tuition-how-retirees-can-attend-college-for-free"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">US News &amp; World Report</a>, many colleges offer really sweet deals for seniors - in some cases, that means ""seniors"" as young as 50. Check with colleges in your area to find out more about good education opportunities close to you.

7. <strong>Plan time away from your partner</strong>. If time with your spouse has been limited largely due to evenings and weekends, finding yourself with him or her day in and day out can create stress in your relationship. It's wonderful to have more time to enjoy your spouse, but remember it's also important for both of you to have activities you enjoy separately.

8. <strong>Make new friends.</strong>&nbsp;A good support network is essential for retirees. While it's nice to remain friendly with former coworkers, try to meet and spend time with other retirees (and old friends) as well. Classes, volunteer activities, senior centers and places of worship are all good places to meet and begin friendships with your peers.

9. <strong>Be active.</strong>&nbsp;Staying physically active is one of the best ways to beat boredom and depression. Plant a garden, sign up for an exercise class, get a few friends together and put in an exercise video, or take your dog for a walk. (If you don't have a dog, you can offer to walk a friend's or neighbor's pet). Keep your mind active by taking a class to learn a new skill or by reading the morning paper and then doing the crossword puzzle.

As much as you may have looked forward to your retirement, it often takes time to adjust to your new lifestyle. If you continue to find yourself bothered by feelings of sadness or depression, however, consider seeing a counselor to discuss your feelings. With a little time and work -&nbsp;<strong>yes, work</strong>! - retirement can indeed turn out to be one of the best times of your life!

563,"Be the ""CEO"" of Your Own Caregiving","As an internationally recognized <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com"">caregiving expert</a> who has been in the field for over two decades - and written the highly acclaimed book <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/the-caregivers-survival-handbook/"">“The Caregivers Survival Handbook”</a> - I can promise you that <strong><em>taking care of the caregiver</em></strong> is certainly one of the most important aspects of your caregiving journey!

Currently there are over 44 million “caregivers” caring for an aging loved one in the United States — nearly one in four U.S. households is involved in caring for a relative or friend aged 50 or older.  It’s estimated that more than 80 million people in the U.S. will have two or more chronic conditions by the year 2020.

Clearly many caregivers are caught between the needs of their young families and the daunting task of caring for their elderly relatives. Watching a loved one grow old is filled with emotional upheaval, and when you compound that with other stresses—rush-hour traffic, deadlines, sick children, dirty laundry—caregivers are often left holding the bag. They feel a pressure to be all things to all people, often ending up as the martyr and giving themselves the short end of the stick.

<a href=""http://www.caregiver.org/jsp/home.jsp"">Caregiving is largely a women’s issue.</a> Some 72 percent of caregivers are female, mostly wives and adult daughters. The average age of a caregiver is 47. More than one in three, however, are mature adults themselves (65 years of age and older). Caregiving can last from less than a year to over forty years. 80 percent of caregivers provide at least some type of unpaid assistance seven days a week. By 2030 one in five Americans will be at least 65, for a total of approximately 70 million older people, more than twice the number than hit 65 in 1996.

Although it’s been well documented that the need for informal or “family caregivers” will rise exponentially over the next few decades, unfortunately the availability of this <em>type</em> of caregiver is expected to rapidly decline. Five social trends are affecting the projected serious decrease in the supply of unpaid caregivers in the future:
<ol>
 	<li>Increasing divorce and remarriage rates</li>
 	<li>Increasing geographic mobility</li>
 	<li>Decreasing family size</li>
 	<li>Delayed childbearing</li>
 	<li>More women in the workplace</li>
</ol>
The stress on a caregiver can be devastating, especially if they are considered to be the primary caregiver in the family and have limited time due to their job and/or other familial responsibilities. The most common feeling informal primary caregivers have toward aging loved ones is guilt. Guilt can be destructive, making one feel tired, weak and immobile.

No matter how much you do, there may be times when you tell yourself that you could do better.

Personally, having been a primary caregiver myself for over 10 years, I suggest you try to not only recognize – but if at all possible - <strong><em>accept </em></strong>these feelings of guilt.  Without recognition, guilt can be a destructive force. Know where these feelings a coming from and be aware that you are not alone in having such thoughts. The following tips will guide you on your way to saying goodbye to caregiver guilt.

<strong><a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/doctor-a-being-the-best-caregiver-you-can-be/"">10 Tips To Help You Say Goodbye To Caregiver Guilt</a></strong>

<strong>Acknowledge your feelings.</strong> Negative feelings can make us feel uneasy and guilty, but it’s important to understand that feelings of anger and resentment are natural and common. Unless these feelings control us, and our behavior toward our parents, they are not bad.

<strong>Think quality, not quantity.</strong> If you’re feeling guilty that you aren’t spending enough time with your aging loved ones, think of how you can improve the quality of your time together. Spending time reminiscing with your mother or playing a game of checkers with your father, for example, may mean more than cleaning their kitchen or delivering a pot roast.

<strong>Establish priorities. </strong>While no one has the time or energy to do everything for everybody, you must find time (and energy) to do the things that are most important to you. By establishing priorities – and allowing some flexibility for the unexpected – you can help ensure that the most important needs are met and the most important tasks get done.

<strong>Set limits.</strong> If your loved ones constant demands are running you ragged, decide (and clearly acknowledge) what you are able and willing to do for them. By setting limits and standing behind them, you can help reduce the guilt trips that come when you can’t meet their every demand.

<strong>Redefine your concept of caring.</strong> If you find it difficult to provide loving, ‘hands-on’ care for your parent, don’t feel guilty – simply think of other tangible ways you can help provide for their care.

<strong>Act from love, not from a sense of debt</strong>. If you think of caring for an aging loved one as repayment for all they’ve done for you, you’ll always end up in the red. Instead, think of caregiving as one person helping another out of love.

<strong>Forgive and seek forgiveness</strong>. If your parent was abusive or uncaring when you were a child, now is the time to forgive – even if you truly feel he or she doesn’t deserve it. Holding grudges will not only affect your ability to care for your aging loved one, but it will also hurt you.

<strong>Foster their independence. </strong>Don’t feel guilty for not doing things for your loved one that they could be doing for themselves. Instead, look for ways to help them do what they can. Something as simple as a $1.29 pill dispenser can help your parent become more independent – and can free up precious time for you.

<strong>Face the facts.</strong> Despite how much you want to help, sometimes your aging relative needs round-the-clock care and constant supervision that you can’t provide. When that happens, acknowledge that someone (or some place) may be better equipped to provide the majority of your parent’s care than you are.

<strong>Don’t succumb to peer pressure.</strong> Acknowledge, but don’t be unduly influenced by, the advice you get from friends and coworkers. Do what your heart tells you is best and what your circumstances permit.

567,"Innovative Programs to Help Seniors Age in Place","For an aging person, the move to a skilled nursing facility is a costly one. Nationwide, the average annual cost of a semi-private room in a skilled nursing facility (nursing home) in 2011 was $78,110, according to the <a href=""https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2011/mmi-market-survey-nursing-home-assisted-living-adult-day-services-costs.pdf"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2011 MetLife Market Survey of Nursing Home, Assisted Living, Adult Day Services, and Home Care Costs Survey</a>. And the cost is clearly rising!

The majority of the cost of care in a skilled nursing facility is borne by taxpayers through Medicaid. At $78,110 annually, it doesn't take long for even the most financially prepared senior to go through their retirement savings and other assets to qualify for Medicaid.

But the financial burden is not the only ""cost"" felt by seniors who must move into skilled nursing facilities. Whether they are leaving the home where they raised their families, the community where they looked forward to spending their retirement years, or the assisted living center where they had hoped to live the rest of their lives with a degree of autonomy, the move to a nursing home costs them their freedom and independence.

Certainly, there will always be a place for skilled nursing facilities, because there will always be frail older adults who need the level of care only they can suitably offer. However, there may be just as many ""would-be"" nursing home residents who could successfully and happily age in place -- whatever place they choose -- at great savings to tax payers, if they had that option.

Fortunately, some agencies are funding (and states are instituting) programs to make it more possible for older adults to age in place at a significant savings of money and personal dignity.

In Georgia, for example, the recent passage of <a href=""http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/display/33269"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Senate Bill 178</a> increases the chances that residents of the state's licensed personal care homes will be able to live out their lives in a ""homelike"" setting by allowing larger homes to provide additional services, including administering medications, that residents often need as they grow older and more frail.

The cost savings of allowing residents to stay in personal care homes rather than moving them to skilled nursing care would be significant. According to the previously mentioned <a href=""https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2011/mmi-market-survey-nursing-home-assisted-living-adult-day-services-costs.pdf"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MetLife survey</a>, the average monthly price of a private room in a licensed personal care home in Georgia is $2,818, compared to $6,500 for a semi-private room in a skilled nursing facility.

In Connecticut, <a href=""http://www.cga.ct.gov/coa/pdfs/AginginPlaceTF/Aging%20In%20Place%20Task%20Force%20FINAL%20report.pdf"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Senate Bill 138</a>, Special Act 12-6 established a task force to study how the state can encourage ""aging in place."" The task force's recommendations, which are generally low-cost ideas (that could improve the ability of Connecticut residents to age in place without needing a budget appropriation) focus on areas such as instituting or increasing tax deductions and tax credits for caregivers and long-term care insurance premiums, improving public transportation options and nutrition services (including aggregate dining and meal delivery) for seniors, engaging in long‐term strategies to meet the demand for direct-care workers and changing zoning regulations to allow for in-law apartments for caregivers in single-family housing.

In addition to state initiatives such as these, many individual communities are instituting their own ""age-in-place"" initiatives with grants from programs such as <a href=""http://www.ciaip.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Community Innovations for Aging in Place Initiative (CIAIP)</a>, which was authorized by Congress to assist communities in their efforts to enable older adults to sustain their independence and age in place in their own homes.

<strong>Some of the programs funded through CIAIP grants include:</strong>

• <strong><a href=""http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/learn/civic-community/community-innovations-for-aging-in-place-program.html"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Boston Medical Center's Services to Help At-Risk Elders Age in Place (SHARE)</a></strong> - this is a program that helps older adult who were previously homeless to age in place by providing ""comprehensive, individualized, ongoing case management"" targeted to the specific needs of these individuals.

• <strong><a href=""http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/HCLTC/CIAIP/docs/City_of_Montpelier_VT_Summary.pdf"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Rural Elder Assistance for Care and Health (REACH) Care Bank</a></strong> - a network of people and organizations coordinating multiple avenues of mutual support instituted by the City of Montpelier, Vt. REACH Care Bank is a new social enterprise that will foster health, wellness and resiliency for elders, caregivers, people of all abilities and vulnerable populations who need expanded services to build livable communities for elders of all income levels and facilitate aging-in-place by engaging the community at large in the exchange for services and time.

• <strong><a href=""http://www.sown.org/GHLT.html"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SOWN: Growing Healthy Lives Together</a> </strong>- this is a comprehensive healthy living program for older adults, predominately women, who are aging in place in their homes. The project is targeted to serve a West Philadelphia neighborhood that has a very high percentage of minority, poor older adults living alone, with chronic multiple health conditions.

• <strong><a href=""http://www.rwjf.org/en/about-rwjf/newsroom/newsroom-content/2012/10/ten-remarkable-men-and-women-named-2012-rwjf-community-health-le/californian-works-to-keep--older-adults-safe-whether-at-home-or-.html"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Older Adult Outreach and Engagement Project</a> </strong>- a project of the Catholic Charities Diocese of Stockton (Calif.) and several other agencies designed to expand the current Older Adult Outreach and Engagement Program by adding new services and strengthening existing ones. The primary goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive, community-coordinated case management system that is responsive and addresses the diverse needs of older adults residing in rural areas, enabling more elderly residents to safely age in place, continue to live independently in their community while retaining the dignity and respect they have earned.

These are just a few of the recent initiatives that are currently being offered to help seniors age in place. But they are just a start! As more baby boomers reach the 65-year mark each day, the need for varied and affordable senior care options will increase. There is no doubt that baby boomers will not be satisfied with the traditional nursing home environment and our society is certainly not able bear the cost.",,"2013-01-10 06:49:22",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=567,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shutterstock_64778809.jpg,"aging in place","tips to help seniors age in place","Dr. Alexis Abramson writes tips to help seniors age in place","aging in place",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shutterstock_64778809.jpg,,"Caregiving|Lifestyle|Marketing to Boomers",,,4,86,none,,,,76,2159,innovative-programs-to-help-seniors-age-in-place,"aging in place","Programs for aging in place - advice for seniors","Innovative legislation in several states is allowing for better conditions for aging in place, help for those who don't want the move to a nursing facility.",,,660,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",aging-in-place,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 18:13:23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
572,"Having the Sex Talk with Your Parent","Many years ago your mom or dad probably had ""the talk"" with you. Perhaps over your teen and young-adult years your parent(s) initiated many talks about love, dating, sex and the selection of a life partner. Now, as the adult child of an aging parent you may find the tables have turned, and it's <strong>your</strong> turn to have ""the talk."" Sure, it's hard. It was probably hard for your mom or dad, too. But they loved you enough to do it. Shouldn't you do the same for them?

As they say, it's a whole new world out there. In some ways that's true. If your parent is recently widowed or divorced, or has decided after some time of singledom that it's time to look for love, here are 7 pieces of advice you may want to offer for dating in the 21st century.
<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eyPTVG-ARr8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></div>
1. <strong>Keep your cell phone charged.</strong> When you were dating, your parents likely had you carry change for a pay phone -- just in case. Today, a pay phone is a rare find and a couple of quarters just won't cut it if Mom needs to call for help or a ride home. (Carrying quarters is still a good idea for toll plazas and parking meters, however.) Make sure your parent doesn't leave the house without a fully charged cell phone - but remind Dad to avoid using the phone to check on sports scores, grandchildren or the latest cool apps. His focus should be on his date - not his phone.

2. <strong>Don't show too much skin.</strong> Mom wouldn't have let you out the door wearing a micro-mini skirt or a skimpy bikini. Now it's time for you to broach the subject of modesty with her. (The same goes for Dad - tiny Speedos are an absolute ""no-no"" if he takes a lady friend to the beach or pool!). If mom wants to look sexy for her date, a turtleneck probably isn't a good idea either, but neither is a plunging neckline that shows <strong>way </strong>too much cleavage.

3. <strong>Let your date do the talking.</strong> If your parent has lived alone for a while, it can be tempting to talk when she finds a listening ear. But remind her of the one rule of dating that has persisted even since she was a teenager: Let your date do the talking. By asking questions and listening more than talking, she shows her date she is interested in him. She also gets to know more about him to decide just how interested she <em>really</em> is. Besides, if he also knows the rule, he'll make an effort to ask questions and give her ample opportunity to talk, too.

4. <strong>Viagra works.</strong> To your parents' distress, the ability to get an erection was probably never an issue for the pimply-faced teenager you dated. For as many as 25 percent of 65-year-old men, however, erectile dysfunction is a regular problem, according to the <a href=""http://consensus.nih.gov/1992/1992impotence091html.htm"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">National Institutes of Health</a>. And an even larger percentage experience at least occasional trouble with achieving or maintaining an erection. Fortunately, for many men, an oral medication taken shortly before sexual activity helps. If your parent is at the point of seeking a physically intimate relationship, a discussion with the doctor might be in order.

5. <strong>Use Protection.</strong> Obviously regardless of age one can still get sexually transmitted diseases (although your parents may have referred to venereal disease, or VD, in their talks with you) and many unfortunately do. According to<a href=""http://www.fpa.org.uk/pressarea/pressreleases/2010/september/fpa-warns-of-rising-stis-and-poor-sexual-health-in-the-over-50s"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> England's Family Planning Agency (FPA)</a>, the number of reported cases of STDs among 50-to 90-year-olds has more than doubled in the past decade, perhaps due in part to the availability of drugs mentioned previously. Remind dad (or mom) to always carry along a condom.

6. <strong>Don't rush into a relationship.</strong> If your parent is recently divorced or widowed remind them (as they may have frequently reminded you) that it's not wise to jump into a relationship too quickly. While most counselors recommend waiting at least a year to remarry after a divorce or death of a spouse, your parent, understandably, may feel that life is too short to wait around once they have found, ""the one."" No, you can't tell your parent what to do in matters of love, but it may be helpful to remind them that while loneliness is not good, spending the rest of their life with the wrong person is worse. At least you'll know you tried.

7. <strong>Be cautious with dates you meet online. </strong>In the 2010 documentary film <a href=""http://www.iamrogue.com/catfish"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Catfish</a>, the young star Nev Schulman discovered that the ""attractive young dancer"" with whom he had an online relationship was actually a middle-age mother of four. If your parent is looking to meet potential love interests online, remind them things aren't always as they seem on the Internet and to beware. More serious than a date who lies about his age or other details is one who is a threat to your parent's safety. In her initial conversations and meetings with an Internet date, ask your mother to use just her cell phone (her home phone can easily be tracked to her home address) and to meet him in a public place.

Ready to have the talk? These 7 pieces of advice should serve as a starting point for the talk, or better yet, an ongoing dialogue with your parent. Whether your parent is alone for the first time in many years or has been on her own for a while now, her desire to look for love is certainly understandable. Your role is to be supportive and understanding.

Having ""the sex talk"" with your parents is admittedly a tricky proposition. My last HuffPost <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexis-abramson-phd/sex-talk-is-it-time-to-have-parent_b_2900138.html?utm_hp_ref=tw"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">blog</a> about this topic set off a stream of comments, some asserting that I was being condescending.  In my <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/bio/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">20 years</a> of working as an advocate for caregivers, baby boomers and mature adults, I've never seen such a strong reaction to a topic.

<strong>""They're old, not stupid""</strong> wrote one HuffPost50 reader.

Rest assured, I would certainly never advise anyone to talk down to his or her parents. Why I chose to address the issue is simple: Sex is different today than it was in the past and it will continue to change with the times.

Just as an example, the <em>New York Times</em> recently <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/booming/baby-boomers-at-risk-for-sexually-transmitted-disease.html?_r=2&amp;"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">reported </a>that more baby boomers are contracting sexually transmitted diseases than ever before, citing both the ""Graying of America"" demographically as well as basic <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/support/elderly/emotional_physical_relationships.shtml"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">physiological and psychological </a>changes that occur as we get older.

By no means did I intend to be patronizing by offering these important tips. The goal was to make sure that mature adults who are re-entering the dating scene -- especially if it's been a long time -- understand that the so-called ""scene"" has dramatically changed over the last decade.

In the case of The Sex Talk, clearly, ""approach and tone"" are everything. It's one thing to say, ""Mom, I heard you're dating again. Be careful out there -- I don't want to see you get hurt,"" versus ""Mom, you really should be carrying protection around with you."" Having the sex talk requires respect and tact ,regardless of age.

""Lay off and let adults be adults, trust me, even at age 80, they can handle their business without the interference of a nosy daughter or son,"" wrote another <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexis-abramson-phd/sex-talk-is-it-time-to-have-parent_b_2900138.html?utm_hp_ref=tw"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">HuffPost</a> reader who commented on my blog.

We can ALL use some sound advice. The advice you've given me is: Be really careful when writing about older people and sex -- it's a touchy subject, to say the least (<em>pun intended</em>)! I agree that one should never speak to someone with more life experience without recognizing and appreciating their wisdom. As a passionate <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/bio/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">advocate</a> in the field of gerontology, this has always been my mantra. But our culture and the subject of dating and sexuality, in general, has definitely changed over the last decade due to advances in technology (<a href=""http://dating.aarp.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">online dating</a>, for instance) and the vast increases in longevity, widowhood and divorce. For example:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>In most cases, women are now freer to be assertive, which challenges traditional etiquette</li>
	<li>New <a href=""http://www.ourtime.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">online dating</a> sites geared toward baby boomers and beyond have created more dating opportunities with different types of people</li>
	<li>More women are financially independent, which may change what they are looking for in a partner</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Many mature adults, especially those 65+ who are recently widowed or divorced, often reach out and tell me it's been a long time since they've been back in the dating scene and a frank conversation is just what they're looking for from anyone who is willing to broach the subject. I believe it's about time we set aside the notion that you can't give advice (sexual or non) to anyone who is older. There are all theses ""taboo"" or ""white elephant in the room"" subjects when it comes to talking with our mature parents -- enough already -- let's open up the lines of communication. It goes both ways!

I also want to make sure we don't forget a central point in this dialogue. Sex is about joy! In many cases those 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years old and beyond now have a second chance that many of their parents did not have -- they can reinvent themselves as a single person (and for you readers who said I looked <strong>""too young"" </strong>to address this subject, I'm 45, but I greatly appreciate your comments!).

Another HuffPost reader commented: ""This advice is as good for young as old now days. There are older people who've lost a partner who never took a chance on having sex 'their way' and they now want to try something different than what they had. I live in a retirement community and hear this a lot.""

In essence, we can all begin to rediscover ourselves as sexual beings. The thought of our parents having sex clearly (according to the blog feedback) seems disturbing to many, but it's happening -- and that's a good thing -- so we need to make sure that our parents and grandparents understand some of the ramifications of the ""new"" dating scene to ensure they practice safe sex and are careful about their choices. Let's have an open discussion about it -- with lots of respect from all sides.

579,"""How to Budget for What Medicare Doesn’t Cover"" (www.marketwatch.com)","By Elizabeth O'Brien

<strong>People planning for retirement tend to budget for the fun stuff, like cruises with grandkids or golf trips in the Sunbelt, and ignore the less fun stuff—especially the costs of post-retirement health care.</strong>

And when boomers find out how much they’re likely to need to cover those medical costs—typically, about a quarter of a million dollars, the experts say—they might wish they hadn’t asked. “All those plans for cruises go out the window if you don’t have adequate coverage,” said Alexis Abramson, a New York based gerontology expert. But understanding what kinds of costs and calculations lie behind that number can make it less intimidating, and help you prepare.

Fidelity Investments, which oversees some 12 million 401(k) accounts, has been a bellwether in setting expectations on this topic. This spring, for example, it released a study saying that an average 65-year-old couple retiring in 2012 would need to have saved up $240,000 to pay for out-of-pocket health-care costs in retirement.

And that’s $240,000 in today’s dollars, so a couple retiring in 10 years would need the inflated-adjusted equivalent in the year 2022. (In its 11 years of doing this study, Fidelity has found the rate of health-care inflation to average 6% per year; assuming that rate stayed constant, a 2022 retiree would need about $430,000 set aside.)

Some experts aren’t comfortable with using a number like Fidelity’s as a benchmark. A single number can be misleading in this context, said Paul Fronstin, director of the health research and education program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI): “If you plan to be average, you have a 1% chance of being right.”

Still, Fronstin and other critics say it helps to have a starting point when it comes to figuring out retirement health-care costs. (EBRI put out its own series of estimates last month that segmented retirees based on their drug expenses.) If nothing else, such numbers drive home the point that Medicare doesn’t cover everything.

In fact, of all the money spent on health care for people 65 and over, Medicare accounts for just 59%, according to an EBRI analysis of actual expenditures; out-of-pocket spending covered 13% and private insurance paid for 14% (the rest was covered by Medicaid and other sources).

Private insurance includes so-called Medigap policies that reduce holders’ out-of-pocket health-care costs; these cost retirees anywhere from roughly $100 to more than $400 a month.

Estimates for retirement health-care costs become more meaningful when you understand the assumptions behind them. Fidelity’s estimates, for example, assume that the retiree couple use traditional Medicare, but not Medicare Advantage, a program offered by private companies contracted with the government, said Sunit Patel, senior vice president of Fidelity’s Benefits Consulting Group.

The study looked at a broad range of health expenses and took the average. Certainly, physical condition influences lifetime health-care costs: A 65-year-old with untreatable cancer will have to save less than someone with a manageable chronic condition. And even a very healthy person might have to budget for medical advances that we can’t even imagine now.

Fidelity’s study also assumes that the couple doesn’t have any employer retiree health benefits—these still exist, especially among the largest companies—and that the man lives to age 82 and the woman to age 85. Here’s a breakdown of where their $240,000 goes: 32% goes to premiums for Medicare Parts B &amp; D, which cover doctor visits and drugs, respectively; 23% goes to prescription drugs expenses not covered by Medicare Part D; and 45% goes toward Medicare cost-sharing provisions, including copayments, deductibles, other services not covered by Medicare, and any optional Medigap policies purchased.

For all their detail, Fidelity and EBRI’s retirement health-care estimates have a whopping exclusion: the cost of long-term care, which could be provided at home or in an assisted living or nursing facility. Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care costs, and Medicaid only covers them for seniors who meet stringent income and asset limitations that vary from state to state. According to projections by the congressional Budget Office, 45% of those who turned 65 in 2010 will eventually need nursing home care for some length of time, and only 9% will need it for five years or more. The median annual cost of nursing home care in the U.S. is $81,030 for a private room, according to insurer Genworth, but here, too, there are big regional variations.

And what about people who live beyond the average life expectancy? After all, both members of Fidelity’s hypothetical couple will be dead by age 85. But a couple that reaches that age faces further out-of-pocket health care costs of $140,000, excluding nursing home care, and $200,000 including nursing home care, according to a 2010 study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

These numbers seem less overwhelming if you budget for them, advisers say, and thinking of them in annual chunks helps, too. Dan Keady, the director of financial planning for TIAA-CREF, recommends people planning for retirement budget a line item of $5,000 per year per person for out-of-pocket health-care costs.

Abramson, the gerontologist, recommends that people set aside 5% of their annual budget to health-care expenses, even before they stop working. If they’re lucky enough not to need the full amount in any given year, she recommends using the remainder to fund healthy activities, like joining a gym.

To be sure, not everyone recommends budgeting specifically for health care costs in retirement. Mitch Reiner, a financial planner in Atlanta, has observed that as his clients move into old age, they spend less on entertainment and travel. Those funds can be redirected to health-care costs, he said.

Reiner stress tests his clients’ portfolios to see if they can support the cost of long-term care, which he models as nest egg withdrawals of 25% to 50% more than planned. He often recommends long-term care insurance for those who can’t self-insure against the risk of those expenses; he suggests that they start doing so around age 55, since premiums tend to rise as people age.

Bottom line? Most people aren’t socking away enough money for retirement, period, said Robert Frank, research scholar at New York University’s Stern School of Business. So it should come as no surprise that many will fall short in meeting their postwork health care expenses. Those will only rise with age, and good heath today doesn’t guarantee good health tomorrow, Abramson said: “All it takes is a fall.” In other words, budget accordingly.",,"2013-03-24 16:11:14",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=579,,,,,,,,"Your Money",,,4,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2018-03-16 16:35:53",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
583,"The “5 Languages of Love” of Caregiving","For years, research has shown that caring for an aging family member may put a caregiver's health at risk. Now a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168724/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">study </a>suggests that your ""personality type"" can possibly help predict just how risky caregiving might be for you!

To better understand why caregiving takes a greater toll on some people rather than others, researchers analyzed data on 536 people, average age 63, caring for an older adult with multiple impairments. The researchers measured five basic personality traits - neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness.

Not surprisingly, their analysis revealed associations between the caregiver's health and their personality types. For example, extraversion was associated with good mental and physical health, while neuroticism (anxious and easily overwhelmed by stressful experiences) was associated with worse health. Self-efficacy (belief in one's ability to achieve a goal or perform a task) also correlated with better physical and mental health.

Does that mean if you are an anxious introvert you shouldn't be caring for an aging parent? Certainly not! But we all have ""innate"" personality traits, some of which the study suggests might make us better able to withstand the daily stresses that go along with caregiving.

Interestingly, we also have different ways of showing love or caring. Understanding those specific ""tendencies"" might also help caregivers identify the tasks for which they are best-suited - and help relieve some of the stress that arises when you perceive one family caregiver isn't pulling his or her weight or caring as much as the others.

In the popular series of books, <a href=""http://www.5lovelanguages.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Five Love Languages</a>, author Gary Chapman explains that people express and receive love best through one of five different communication styles: quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and physical touch.

If you're fortunate enough to be sharing caregiving with siblings or other family members, consider divvying up caregiving tasks to divide the load and provide the kind of care that is most meaningful for each caregiver. If you don't currently have help with caregiving, try recruiting family members for tasks based on their communication styles.

Does your brother express love by acts of service, for example? Have him drive your mom to appointments or take care of needed repairs on her house.

Is your sister the ""touchy-feely"" type, showing love through physical touch? Your mom would probably love to have her brush or style her hair or sit with her and just hold her hand.

Does your niece never let an occasion pass without sending a card or gift? A week's worth of frozen, prepared meals or an occasional bouquet of flowers to brighten her home - and her mood - are gifts your mother would likely love.

One mistake caregivers often make is thinking they have to do it all themselves, and that can wear anyone down, regardless of their personality type. If you've fallen into the sole caregiver role because you feel it is your cross to bear, or you have difficulty being assertive enough to say ""no,"" your personality itself may be putting you at an increased risk for the detrimental effects of caregiving stress. It's time for you to insist on help!

Making the most of caring communication styles can help relieve stress for everyone involved in the caregiving process, while ensuring that the person you're caring for is getting the care he or she needs.

870,"Expect to Be a Caregiver: Plan Early","When adult children are faced with a parent's sudden health crisis and must make decisions about ongoing care and living arrangements, the need to act quickly can take an emotional toll on the whole family. <strong>Dr. Alexis Abramson</strong>, author of <em>The Caregiver's Survival Handbook: How to Care for Your Aging Parent Without Losing Yourself</em>, talks with <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> about the importance of long-range planning, and of keeping your parents in the loop—and their wishes top-of-mind—as they become more dependent.

<strong>You warn adult children against sweeping in and taking over for their parents. What's the danger?</strong>
When you lose your independence and you begin to have to be dependent on someone else, the emotions about the losses involved become very strong. That's why so many mature adults become depressed and can become angry. We can avoid some of this by respecting how they feel and what they're thinking. Rather than just make decisions on behalf of our parents, we can help them make decisions.

<strong>You suggest that the decision-making should begin long before anything actually starts to change. What's the advantage?</strong>
I can not emphasize enough the importance of planning. Let's say Monday they're fine, and Tuesday they have a stroke, but you have no idea what their preferences would be—to bring in a home healthcare worker or to move them into an assisted living situation, for example. You <em>need</em> to know what their wishes are. It can be very expensive to have to solve a crisis, which often is what happens when a caregiver doesn't plan. If you want to decrease your financial investment in caregiving, increase the emotional comfort level between you and your parent, and allow your parent to age as gracefully as possible, start talking.

You've got to talk to your parents about finances. My grandfather died and he kept telling us over and over and over that he had a bank account in Switzerland but he never told us where it was. We've been looking for it for 20 years now! You need to talk about what their desires are in terms of long-term care—do they want to stay in their home as long as possible? Do they want <em>you</em> to be their full-time caregiver, or would that make them uncomfortable?

<strong>What sort of approach do you recommend to get the conversational ball rolling? </strong>
When the conversations start is individual, and it's really about the disease state that a parent is in. But I think when our healthy parents turn 65, say, when Medicare kicks in, it's probably a good time to start by making an overall assessment.

<strong>When the parent starts to need help, how should children proceed?</strong>
I am a believer that the expectation must be that <em>everyone</em> is involved. You need to talk to your family members about what kind of role they want to play. I think what we often do—especially as women—is take the martyr role and let other siblings off the hook.

You should treat caregiving like it's a business. There should be someone who's the CEO, who delegates responsibilities, but in a way that will motivate. For example, just because your brother's an accountant doesn't mean he wants to handle your parents' finances. Find out what he wants to do. Also, be creative; if your nephew can't find a job and needs to make some money, you pay him to take your mom to the doctor and sit with her. She doesn't ever have to know that.

My feeling is that getting someone in who knows what to look for and who is not emotionally involved—that's really a big part of this. A geriatric care manager is a trained outside observer who can come in and say, ""Is your mom always this thin?"" Sometimes the solution can be as easy as moving food a little bit lower in the cupboard so she can reach it and maybe eat more. They can also help get the right services in place, like home healthcare, or manage the situation locally if you live far from your parent. The National Association of Geriatric Care Managers is pretty fabulous for finding a local geriatric care manager.",,"2020-10-24 06:40:17",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/expect-to-care-for-your-parents-plan-early/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/family-meeting.jpg,"family meeting",,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/family-meeting.jpg,,Caregiving,,,4,86,,,,,71,1710,,"Caring for your parents","Caring for your parents - plan early","When it comes to caring for your parents as they age, planning ahead is crucial.",,,789,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2013-05-24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",expect-to-care-for-your-parents-plan-early,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 18:11:07",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
915,"Technology ""Must Haves"" for the 50+  ","When it comes to technology, businesses are realizing that the 50+ demographic -- which has at times been overlooked in terms of the marketing of new technologies - is actually extremely interested in innovative “50+ friendly” technology.

As a matter of fact, the marketplace for technology to assist aging adults is expected to grow sharply from $2 billion today to more than $20 billion by 2020, according a report from <a href=""http://www.ageinplacetech.com"">Aging in Place Technology Watch</a> - and boomers are going to be on the receiving end of the advancements and innovations.

I’m often asked about 50+ technology in my <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/dr-alexis-approved/"">Dr. Alexis Approved</a> blog - so I thought I would share a few of the most frequently asked questions.  I hope they help you learn more about the advanced technology (and fun gadgets!) available for boomers, caregivers and seniors.

&nbsp;

<b> 1.  We’ve all seen the old reliable plastic “pill box” our parents used.  What products are available for those boomers who forget to take their medications or those who take their meds, but forgot they did?</b>

Baby boomers rely on their medications to keep them healthy, but complex medication schedules can lead to mistakes: missing doses, taking incorrect amounts, or taking medicines at the wrong times. These mistakes could result in unnecessary doctor or hospital visits, illness and even death.  It’s currently estimated that about <a href=""http://www.healthdesign.org"">one third to one half</a> of baby boomers do not take their medications as prescribed.  With the complexity of medications many seniors take, it's no surprise that <a href=""http://www.healthdesign.org/chd/resources/publications"">1 in 10 hospital admissions</a> for seniors are a result of medication errors.  A plethora of new products and services have recently been introduced to the market to not only prompt patients to take their medications <i>on</i> <i>time</i> but also in the <i>correct dosages</i>.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<b style=""font-size: 14px;""><a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/pharmacy/infusion_services.jsp"">Walgreens Rx App</a></b><span style=""font-size: 14px;""> - Walgreens added a new feature to its mobile health app called Pill Reminder.  Pill reminder aims to help pharmacy customers track their medication schedules and receive alerts. The alerts can be scheduled nine different ways, including daily, hourly, weekly (and more customizable options).  Users can also add multiple prescriptions, vitamins and other supplements to a single reminder notification.</span>

<b><a href=""http://www.managemypills.com/content"">The Philips Medication Dispenser</a></b> – This is an electronic voice output medication reminder and dispenser designed for use by individuals with vision, memory or cognitive disabilities.  Medications are placed in a one-ounce plastic cup, loaded in the dispenser and administered as scheduled.  Caregivers can view their loved one’s activity through Philips Monitoring report which is available online, 24 hours per day.

&nbsp;

<b> 2.  If an active baby boomer had to choose between purchasing an iPad or a laptop which one would you suggest and why?</b>

Personally I think the iPad is a great choice - especially for those baby boomers who are “on the go” and just need a user-friendly and lightweight computer to access their email, catch up on the news, search the web, buy products, etc.  The iPad is easy to carry and store, and using it is as simple as swiping your finger across the screen (which is especially helpful for those 50+ buyers who have arthritis or gripping/dexterity problems in their hands and joints). There is also no need for a mouse or any additional devices to be attached - which makes the product fairly “hassle-free” it terms of trying to remember all the extra attachments that might normally be needed for other types of devices.  Among the most convenient features is the ability to zoom in on text, making it larger and easy to read just in case the user has low vision.  Finally, one does not need to be technically strong to operate a tablet and the iPad is considered by most 50+ users to be more intuitive than many of its competitors.  However, please note that tablets, in general, are mainly <i>content consumption</i> devices rather than <i>workstations</i>. This simply means that, if you want to type in a lot of text or if you need to deliver large-scale projects a tablet may not be the right device for you.

&nbsp;

<b>3.  Is there any innovative technology available for those folks who are 50+ that want more independence or might need to reach help in the case of an emergency?
</b>

New and improved technologies emphasize wellness, mobility, autonomy and social connectivity.   These innovative products and services are being properly positioned to promote health and independence for aging baby boomers and older adults.  Here are a few of my favorite examples of advanced technology in the lifestyle, communications and emergency monitoring space:

<b> <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vtech_careline.jpg""><img class=""alignleft  wp-image-917"" alt=""vtech_careline"" src=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vtech_careline-293x170.jpg"" width=""176"" height=""102"" /></a></b>

<b>
4.  Are there any electronic devices for boomers who love to travel?</b>

Baby boomers comprise an increasing share of the nation’s travelers.  In fact, according to the <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/Topics/Demographics/Seniors.aspx?typeFilter=5"">Pew Internet and American Life Project</a>, approximately 80% of leisure travel is comprised of baby boomers and beyond.  New accommodating technology, such as automated check-ins and check-outs, make life easier on the road for both business and leisure boomer travelers.  Here are a few gadgets that will make your next trip a little less stressful and a lot more enjoyable!<span style=""font-size: 14px;""> </span>

<b> 5.  With technology changing daily and new gadgets constantly hitting the market - what are some examples of a few additional products boomers (and beyond) should look to purchase that may make their lives easier - or just maybe a bit more fun? </b>

Baby boomers have a massive amount of economic clout and certainly the sheer numbers to change the face of technology.  By 2020, <a href=""http://www.inclusionsolutions.com/Advocacy"">116 million Americans</a> will be over 50 and their current <a href=""http://www.boomerproject.com"">3.4 trillion annual buying power</a> will only continue to increase.  Adults over the age of 50 expect technology to be safe, easy to use and flexible enough to adapt to their individual needs.  Health, leisure activities and socialization are three areas that boomer technology companies are focusing on and will continue to do so as baby boomers continue to age!  Below are a few great gadgets that will help make life easier (and more fun!) for baby boomers!<b> </b>

919,"Avoid Butting Heads with Your Parents","You can’t eliminate all disagreements and uncomfortable situations with your older parents, but you can often resolve conflicts and make your relationships run more smoothly, if you just know how!  The following 10 tips will help you avoid butting heads with your aging loved ones.<b></b>

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><b></b><b>Start early.  </b>There are some issues that almost all caregivers will face at some point, including changing living arrangements, drawing up a will or giving up driving.  If they haven’t arisen yet, discussing them with your older family member before decisions <i>must</i> be made can be a lot less stressful.  For starters – just click here and you can find a list of the <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/5-legal-documents-you-need-for-your-parents/"">five most important legal documents</a> your parents need to have in place prior to a potential caregiving crisis.</li>
	<li><b>Pick your battles.  </b>As a caregiver, you will most likely encounter situations where you have to override your parent’s wish to keep him or her safe and well.  But do so only when necessary!  If your father wants to drive his car after his license has been revoked, for example, it’s your responsibility to stop him.  If he wants to wear red plaid pants with a blue striped shirt or put up his Christmas tree in August, let it slide.</li>
	<li><b>Foster your parent’s independence.  </b>Some older adults sit back and prefer to be waited on.  But many would much rather do things themselves – if they can.  By allowing your parents to do the tasks they are physically able to do you will help boost their self-esteem and maintain their independence.  One great technology that emphasizes wellness, communication, autonomy and social connectivity is the <a href=""http://www.vtechphones.com/careline"">VTech CareLine ™</a> - this easy-to-use home phone system was designed with experts in aging and technology to answer seniors’ daily communications needs and support hearing, dexterity or vision challenges.</li>
	<li><b>Enlist the help of professionals.  </b>Even though you may be closer to your aging loved one than anyone else, that doesn’t mean you have to be the bearer of all bad news.  If you think your mom needs to see a psychiatrist - or trade in her high-heel pumps for safer shoes - it might make sense to have a trusted doctor, social worker or gerontologist broach the subject with her.  A great resource for professional guidance is the <a href=""http://www.caremanager.org"">National Association of Geriatric Care Managers</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Let your parents live in their own world.  </b>If your father’s college football stories or your mother’s insistence that she’s never met your husband (despite the fact that she’s known him for 30 years) drives you up a wall, don’t let on.  How many times has your child or best friend told you the same story over and over?  Try acting amazed when you hear about that winning touchdown for the thousandth time or tell your mom that you’d love to introduce her to your husband (just make sure you let him in on the role playing!).  If you feel your loved one is experiencing an unusual amount of memory loss you might want to go to the <a href=""http://www.alz.org"">Alzheimer’s Association</a> website for additional information.</li>
	<li><b>Don’t make assumptions.  </b>If you need to make a decision regarding your loved one’s care, don’t always assume you know what’s best for them.  One article I read recently said that most caregivers thought a parent would be better off moving in with them, while most older adults said they would prefer to stay in their own homes or live in an assisted-living facility. If your parent is cognitively and mentally able to participate in decisions regarding his or her own care, by all means ask for input.</li>
	<li><b>Consider your parent’s feelings.  </b>It’s not always easy getting older.  If you look at things from your parent’s perspective – and consider that you will most likely be in the same situation one day – you’ll realize it’s smarter to let go of past grudges that might lead to conflict and simply forgive.  One of the reasons we tend to hold on to grudges is a sense of guilt – the overall feeling that we aren’t doing enough for our aging loved ones, ourselves or anyone else for that matter!  Click here to find my 10 tips for <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/caregiver-guilt-advice/"">saying goodbye to caregiver guilt</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Allow your parent to call the shots – sometimes.  </b>Many of the challenges that arise in caregiving come when parents feel they are no longer useful or in control.  As with parenting your own child, it’s important to give your parents some power in the family – particularly if he or she lives in your home with you.  If possible, allow them to plan meals, or pick TV shows or family activities now and then.</li>
	<li><b>Use positive reinforcement.  </b>It’s easy to criticize when things aren’t going well, especially when you’re overwhelmed and exhausted.  But instead of complaining when things go wrong, try praising your parent when things go right.  Chances are your parent wants to please you and will appreciate the encouragement.  The <a href=""http://www.caregiver.org"">Family Caregiver Alliance</a> offers four different online support groups for caregivers and their aging loved ones – these groups might just help ease the stress you’re feeling and help you employ useful coping mechanisms.</li>
	<li><b>Reconsider your arrangements.  </b>If constant conflicts with your parents are having a negative impact on your health and your immediate family, you may have no choice but to make other arrangements for their care.  If he or she is living in your house, perhaps your parent could live with another family member or move into an assisted-living residence.  If you’re providing most of the care – perhaps another family member could take over some of the duties.  If you’re looking for a referral source to help you find a housing resource in your area, there’s a great new website called <a href=""http://www.caresquad.com"">www.caresquad.com</a> that will point you in the right direction!</li>

921,"Yahoo! Voices Talks with Dr. Alexis","by Art Eddy, III

Dr. Alexis Abramson is an industry expert for people over 50. Dr. Abramson and her team, work across a broad spectrum of industries including healthcare, consumer products, retail, technology, finance, real estate, travel, tourism, automotive, media, entertainment and fashion.

Alexis Abramson has written books on these topics. I was able to ask her a few questions on her research and how to be a good caregiver to the baby boomer generation.

<b>Art Eddy: Tell me a bit about the work that you do with people over 50 years old?</b>

Alexis Abramson: I'm a leading industry expert, a futurist of sorts, as it relates to the business and lifestyle of those over the age of 50. I have a PhD in Gerontology, the field of aging, and have dedicated my work to helping people fully embrace what I like to refer to as the ""30 Bonus Years."" These are the additional ""bonus"" or ""gifted"" years that we now have the luxury to experience, and hopefully enjoy, as we grow older. Due mainly to technology and medical breakthroughs, the average life expectancy went from 47 in the 1900's to 77 and beyond today - now that we will be living much longer many people approaching retirement age find they are definitely not ready to just step aside from life and be forgotten!

My work is mainly focused as a keynote speaker, blogger, on air expert and corporate consultant - I spend the majority of my time discussing how we can all live healthier, wealthier and wiser during the second half of our lives. I'm absolutely committed to baby boomers, caregivers and mature adults - I intend to disrupt the way people currently look at aging! I believe that longer life spans will allow us to experience a much broader range of activities that we, previously, never imagined we would be able to make a part of our lives. In essence, I spend my time endorsing living life to the fullest at any age!

<b>AE: What have you seen over the last few years about baby boomers and how retirement has been for them in this economy?</b>

AA: Despite the faltering economy of the last five years, American older adults are better off than ever, in large part because more seniors, especially older women, are working than in previous decades. According to a 2012 report from the Federal Agency Forum, the number of senior citizens living in poverty has declined from 15 percent to 9 percent since the mid-1970s, while the proportion of older Americans enjoying a ""high income"" increased from 18 to 31 percent. Older people are more active and vibrant than ever before, responsible for 50% of all discretionary income and spending upwards of $3 trillion every year on consumer-related services.

Businesses, foundations and agencies in a wide variety of industries including fashion, fitness, travel, healthcare, transportation, retail and real estate need to be prepared to offer the services demanded by this growing population who are already outspending other generations by an estimated $400 billion each year on consumer goods &amp; services. So even while the escalating number of retirees may begin to strain government resources, they will provide enormous money making opportunities for those who are offering 50+ friendly products and services.

<b>AE: The life expectancy age is now higher. What are some ways people can prepare to make sure they are taken care of after they retire?</b>

I suggest that the preparation and ""decision-making"" begin long before things start to shift in terms of an individual's retirement plans, living arrangements, health status, financial situation, etc. I can't emphasize enough the importance of planning ahead with the assumption that you'll live to 100 - bad back, aching knees and all! Just as an example, in terms of planning from a caregiving perspective you must have ""the talk"" well before a crisis arises and let people know exactly what your wishes are in terms of your care. It can be very expensive, and undesirable, to have to solve a caregiving challenge in crisis mode - which is often exactly what happens when a person doesn't plan ahead.

In addition, you've got to talk to your loved ones about finances. My grandfather died and he kept telling us over and over and over that he had a bank account in <a title=""Switzerland"" href=""http://voices.yahoo.com/topic/11921/switzerland.html"" rel=""&amp;content_type=topic&amp;content_type_id=11921"" data-rapid_p=""1"">Switzerland</a> but he never told us exactly where it was located. We've been looking for it for 20 years now! Basically, if you want to decrease your financial investment in caregiving, increase the emotional comfort level between you and your loved ones, and age as gracefully as possible, start talking now!

<b>AE: Do you find people working after the age of 65 to make ends meet?</b>

Turning 65 is no guarantee that you will be ready or willing to retire. A rapidly growing number of Americans are continuing to work well beyond their 65th birthday. Many workers are now physically able to work beyond traditional retirement age due to continuing good health, innovative technology and medical advances - and therefore they are doing just that! There's definitely a growing realization that if you retire at age 65 and live until you're age 95, you will need to save enough money to pay for 30 years of retirement and you also might want to have something worthwhile to do over that 30 year time period. My impression, and research certainly backs this up, is that people may not be working longer due to just financial reasons - or to make ends meet as you said - but they can and want to continue adding value to their lives and the lives of those around them during those 30 bonus years.

<b>AE: You also focus in on fashion for people 50 and over. What made you focus on that issue?</b>

AA: I'm especially interested in ""functional"" fashion for baby boomer women. For some reason boomer women (and their Moms!) seem to be positioned as an invisible group of consumers that many brands (especially luxury ones) choose to ignore. I have no idea why designers and retailers don't care that women age 50 and older control a net worth of $19 trillion and own/control between two-thirds and three-fourths of the nation's financial wealth, depending on whose statistics you believe.

These ladies are also expected to be the beneficiaries of the largest transfer of wealth in our country's history, in part due to double inheritances from parents and husbands. Between the ages of 55 and 64, they spend more on apparel than any other age group. It just doesn't seem prudent to marginalize a group that practically rules the world. It's no secret that due to normal aging our bodies change - and no matter what our ""body type"" 50+ women look better in specific styles - so why not create a hip clothing line that's both fashionable AND functional for the 50+ woman of today.

<b>AE: One thing I find is that with the baby boomer generation is that they love their ""dumb phones"" and don't want a smartphone? What is your take on some people from that generation who are opposed to technology?</b>

AA: Many people believe, erroneously, that old people can't figure out new technology. Does this really make any sense? While there may be various physiological changes that make it harder to ""teach an old dog new tricks,"" they obviously aren't too overwhelming given the number of older, tech savvy people that are out there. Personally, having been a gerontologist for over 20 years, I have come to this conclusion: Older people tend to be bad at learning new technology because they believe that they're supposed to be bad at learning new technology. End of story.

Sure it may take them a little longer to adopt or learn new technology but I don't believe they necessarily ""love their dumb phone and don't want a smart phone"" as you stated in your question. It's important to remember - changes and advancements in technology have the potential to benefit older adults by promoting independence and increasing their ability to age in place. However, older adults are less likely to adopt new technology unless they see how it might benefit them. Overall, older adults are not negatively biased toward technology. In fact, research tells us that if you actually ask them you will find older adults are usually extremely eager to explain how they use technology in their everyday lives and often express a desire to find out about additional products on the market.

I recently answered a series of questions about great technology for the 50+ - Gadgets Every Boomer Needs - take a look - you might be surprised at the innovative 50+ friendly products that are currently in the marketplace. In the future, technology developed and marketed ""with older adults in mind"" will be the most successful and will help them achieve greater independence and quality of life.

<b>AE: Another subject you focus on is caregiving. What are some of helpful tips you can pass on to those people, young or old, that are taking care of the elderly?</b>

AA: I'm a big believer that the expectation must be that everyone will one day be a caregiver - whether it be for your aging parents, a neighbor, a loved one - we're all likely to be in that position at some point in our lives. As I mentioned earlier, first and foremost you need to talk to your loved ones about caregiving and what kind of role they want to play. Unfortunately what we often do - especially women who currently make up 73% of the over 44 million primary caregivers in the United States - is take on the martyr role and let other family members and friends off the hook.

You should treat caregiving like it's a business. There should be someone who's the CEO, who delegates responsibilities, but in a way that person will motivate and organize the entire caregiving team. For example, just because your brother's an accountant doesn't mean he wants to handle your parents' finances. Find out what he wants to do. Also, be creative; if your nephew can't find a job and needs to make some money, you might think about paying him to take your mom to the doctor and sit with her. That might sound mercenary but frankly she doesn't ever have to know about it.

I also feel strongly that it's important to get a 3rd party expert involved who knows what to look for and who is not emotionally involved. For example, a geriatric care manager is a trained outside observer who might do an assessment and ask, ""Has your mom always been this thin?"" Sometimes the solution can be as easy as moving food a little bit lower in the cupboard so she can reach it and therefore perhaps she will begin to eat more. They can also help get the right services in place, like home healthcare, or manage the situation locally if you live far from your parent. The National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers is pretty fabulous in terms of a referral source for finding a local geriatric care manager.

<b>AE: I am in my thirties and both my wife and I had to at one point take care of our parents. It was tough when we were taking of our kids and our parents. How can my generation balance the role of caretaking with all the other aspects we have in our life?</b>

AA: Having been a caregiver myself for over 10 years and written the book ""The Caregivers Survival Handbook"" I can promise you that ""taking care of the caregiver"" is definitely one of the most important aspects of the caregiving journey! Nearly one in four U.S. households is involved in caring for a relative or friend aged 50 or older - this is an epidemic and it's only going to get worse over the next decade. Clearly many caregivers are caught between the needs of their young families and the daunting task of caring for their elderly relatives.

Watching a loved one grow old is filled with emotional upheaval, and when you compound that with other stresses - rush-hour traffic, deadlines, sick children, dirty laundry - caregivers are often left holding the bag. They feel a pressure to be all things to all people, often ending up giving themselves the short end of the stick. The most common feeling primary caregivers have toward aging loved ones is guilt. Guilt can be destructive, making one feel tired, weak and immobile.

No matter how much you do, there may be times when you tell yourself that you could do better. I suggest you try to not only recognize - but if at all possible - accept these feelings of guilt. Without recognition, guilt can be a destructive force. Know where these feelings a coming from and be aware that you are not alone in having such thoughts. For 10 tips on how to deal with caregiver guilt I've recently written a helpful blog entitled Saying Goodbye to Caregiver Guilt.","Dr. Alexis Abramson is an industry expert for people over 50.

926,"Livable Communities of the Future","As our society moves towards more sustainable living practices, one trend that will benefit people as they age is the increased availability of <a href=""http://www.livable.org"">livable</a> communities where convenience and socializing are built-in luxuries.  Hopefully, as we continue to upgrade our neighborhoods they will be <a href=""http://www.universaldesign.com"">universally designed</a> to be more aesthetically pleasing and accessible for all. Features such as safer, barrier-free buildings, parks and streets will make neighborhoods easy to navigate for both an 80-something senior with a walker and a 20-something mom pushing a stroller!

“While some streets do provide a safe pedestrian environment, it may not be a pleasant one; the absence of benches, scarce landscaping, and storefronts set back from the sidewalk do little to encourage walking” writes the advocacy group <a href=""http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/"">Smart Growth America</a>.  Well-planned livable communities, for all intents and purposes, allow one the benefit of living in a city without the stress of high-crime rates, run down buildings, streets without sufficient lighting, etc.

Furthermore, <a href=""http://www.livablecommunity.org"">successful livable communities</a> have organized activities to promote intergenerational interactions, such as reading programs where older adults are paired with young people through the public library system.  Without a doubt, closer-knit communities also offer more spontaneous moments to enjoy activities such as musical performances, farmers markets with local produce and lively streets lined with outdoor dining choices.

One thing to remember is that with increased  socialization and independence comes the need to make sure you surround yourself with products and services that allow for constant <i>personal</i> independence. A <a href=""http://www.elderluxe.com"">folding cane</a> is good to keep with you in case you feel the need for a bit of extra assistance while walking the streets of the neighborhood. Purchasing an all-in-one telephone and safety device such as the VTech <a href=""http://www.vtechphones.com/careline/careline-home-safety-telephone-system"">CareLine</a><sup>TM</sup> system can help make sure you communicate and stay connected with your family members. Also, a <a href=""http://www.firststreetonline.com/Home+Solutions/Magnification/"">full page magnifying reader</a> to assist you as you tackle the morning paper can be quite helpful in reading small print size. These are all great devices to add to the enjoyment of a livable environment.

As our population continues to age, better access to healthcare is also a key feature offered in this type of living.  If older adults can easily get to their medical providers by themselves, they will feel empowered by not having to continually rely on others for routine health matters.  Also, with respect to health, there is no debate that livable (and walk-able) communities make it easier to integrate exercise into daily living. Yoga and meditation in the park, community swimming pools, and simply not getting in a car as much will do wonders for your overall physical self.

<a href=""http://www.livable.org/"">Partners for Livable Communities</a> is a group that promotes invigorating activities with its overall central focus on basic <i>good living,</i> especially through cultural outlets. Dance, theater, writing and painting are just some of the outlets they recommend we all embrace as we age. As a part of my <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/30-bonus-years/"">30 Bonus Years<b>™</b></a> initiative, I also highly encourage people to explore activities they didn’t have a chance to take on earlier in life.  I firmly believe livable communities promote a sense of engagement – clearly a critical component to fully embracing your later years.

I recently had the opportunity to be featured in a <a href=""https://www.vimeo.com/67857101"">PSA</a> supporting livable communities that was presented at the National Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. The goal was to showcase the importance of creating environments that are more user-friendly for all members of our society – regardless of age!  In order to produce the infrastructure needed to support more livable communities, numerous task forces and initiatives have been formed. These policymakers realize that the need for livable communities is not a generational issue, it simply makes good sense for the future of America.

MetLife, in collaboration with Stanford University, recently released a study citing <a href=""http://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2013/mmi-livable-communities-study.pdf"">Livable Community Indicators</a>, mentioning a wide range of bustling metropolises and university towns working toward creating age-friendly environments. The takeaway here is to choose a place where there is accessible healthcare, solid employment/retirement opportunities, cultural outlets and a strong community of engagement.  As the Internet and technology have made us a more distant society, choosing to live in a sustainable, livable community enables us to connect with people face-to-face, one of the healthiest forms of interaction we can enjoy!",,"2020-07-02 15:00:31",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/livable-communities/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Home-Safety-for-Seniors.jpg,"Home Safety for Seniors",,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Home-Safety-for-Seniors.jpg,,Caregiving|Longevity,,,4,86,,,,,76,4673,livable-communities-of-the-future,"livable communities for older people","Livable communities for older people can make a huge difference","Choosing livable communities for older people to settle in can be a smart choice.

<div id=""float_tracker"" data-beacon=""{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;floating_share&quot;}}"">
<div id=""badges_v2_1"">

I recently read a news article entitled <strong><em>Bucket Lists Gone Bad.</em></strong>...the author proceeded to give examples of ""when senior 'thrills' become life threatening."" As a leading <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/about-dr-alexis/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">50+ expert</a>, I would suggest that this alarmist piece managed to <strong>completely</strong> marginalize anyone over 50 who might be attempting to do anything that's considered physically challenging or risk-taking.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

The article cites an 80-year-old woman who barely survived a tandem skydiving attempt and a 50-year-old man who crashed a motorcycle in the dealership parking lot having had no previous experience riding a bike. Of course these types of accidents can happen, but there's no reason for anyone over 50 to swear off bucket lists filled with adrenaline-pumping activities - at any age we have to measure the potential consequences of our actions! I went skydiving forever ago - on my 25th birthday - and I can promise you my heart was pounding just as hard as any octogenarians would have been!

In fact, I find the whole notion that age should be considered a severely ""limiting factor"" when attempting risky activities quite disturbing. Sure, if you have any health conditions check in with your doctor first - you might be a risk taker but you're not stupid! Aspirations and goals are what make the second half of life empowering - if you don't fulfill them what's the point of dreaming in the first place? This whole risk-averse concept goes against my <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/30-bonus-years/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">30 Bonus Years</a> way of thinking - I firmly believe the second half of life is a chance to explore every possible outlet one can imagine!

The woman who almost died skydiving and the man who crashed the motorcycle were either not properly trained for the tasks or there was faulty equipment. Or perhaps they were just too damn scared and not in ""the moment"" - if you're going to do it take it seriously. The article quotes the emergency room physician who treated the wannabe motorcyclist as saying, ""If you're going to build a bucket list don't fill it with 18 different versions of Russian Roulette."" Motorcycles are dangerous.....regardless of what year you were born....over <a href=""http://www.showmemotorcycles.com/knowing-how-many-people-die-in-motorcycle-accidents-each-year-can-save-a-biker%E2%80%99s-life/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">4000 people</a> die in motorcycle accidents each year - it's clearly not the safest activity - at any age!

The article did a nice job of homogenizing the entire 50+ generation and, in my humble opinion, by attaching such broad generalizations the author managed to suck the fun out of aging - or living - by singling out isolated incidents. If you want to ride a motorcycle, take a course from your local <a href=""http://online2.msf-usa.org/msf/Default.aspx"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">motorcycle safety course</a>. Take time to learn the ins-and-outs of a motorcycle and join the legions of 50+ safe bikers that have a blast riding on a regular basis!

The article also quotes an AARP employee who warns about the dangers of running a marathon or competing in a <a href=""http://toughmudder.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tough Mudder</a> obstacle course race. Even a 22-year-old fitness buff can get injured doing extreme sports. So train properly, read about the best training techniques and join a group with a good coach or leader. And like anyone else, build the necessary strength and endurance your body needs to handle the rigors of the challenge.

Having worked for over two decades with both spry and sloth-like mature adults here's my advice - <strong>PLEASE</strong> don't tear up that bucket list - you just have to be even more studied in your approach. Be patient. Stretching and recovery cannot be skipped. In other words, prepare properly and pay attention to any old injuries that might come into play. Obey the cliché: Listen to your body. When in doubt, take it easy.

Knowing your own limits and true aspirations is also important. Don't add motorcycle riding to your bucket list if you've never really wanted to go fast on two wheels. It's just as admirable to become an expert chess player, try your hand at standup comedy or join an online dating site if you're single (that's probably the riskiest of all!!!).

Bucket lists should be a reflection of your personality. So if you've always been a competitive endurance athlete, by all means try to qualify for the Ironman triathlon and train hard for it. Don't let someone tell you it's impossible at your age - or at any age! We simply don't have to be relegated to the sidelines just because we've had our 50th birthday - get up and ""go for the glory"" golden edgers!

935,"Tips for Caring for the Caregiver","Being the primary caregiver for an older loved one is tough, and expectations are frequently quite high. With that said, there are ways to relieve some of the stress, and much of it revolves around a shift in your mindset. After all, each of us can only do so much before we simply break down! One of the keys to success for maintaining a positive caregiver lifestyle is to take time away from your responsibilities and make time for yourself. Truly try to be “in the moment” and simply enjoy a hobby or other activity that allows you to lose yourself and just let go.

Even if you have the best caregiver support system, on many occasions the needs of your loved ones will become incredibly demanding (at least that’s how it feels). By taking some to time recharge and de-stress, you’ll become a more pleasant and productive caregiver. Making sure you’re getting enough sleep, eating healthy and exercising are all essential elements of caring for the caregiver.

</div>
Here are a few more tips to keep in mind as you go through your caregiving journey:
<ol>

938,"How to Stay Fashionable After 50","There's no reason to stop caring about fashion after a certain age. Instead of resigning to so-called ""age-appropriate"" clothing, why not start developing your own sense of style at 50 or older?

Maybe you grew up in a very conservative environment, so now is the time to explore fashion and learn more about style icons like Jackie Onassis, Jane Birkin or Audrey Hepburn. We see woman over 50 such as actress Diane Keaton and model Lauren Hutton regularly continue to outclass younger starlets because they have remained consistently stylish with clothing that is not only perfect for their age, but also possesses a look that suits their personalities.

Seth Cohen writes the <a href=""http://advancedstyle.blogspot.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Advanced Style blog</a> and has featured hundreds of style profiles of men and women over 60. He told Vogue magazine, ""Advertisers are silly not to focus on such an important and large segment of the population. Youth culture is important but it's sad when everything in the media starts to look the same - so many of the faces are expressionless and lack character, and it doesn't make sense to chase an impossible dream of eternal youth.""

I completely agree. It doesn't make sense that boomer women (and their moms) are constantly positioned as an invisible group of consumers that many brands (especially luxury ones) choose to ignore. I have no idea why designers and retailers don't care that women age 50 and older control a <a href=""http://www.she-conomy.com/facts-on-women"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">net worth</a> of $19 trillion and own/control between two-thirds and three-fourths of the nation's financial wealth. These ladies are also expected to be the beneficiaries of the largest transfer of wealth in our country's history, in part due to double inheritances from parents and husbands. Between the ages of 55 and 64, they spend more on apparel than any other age group.

The good news is that we are beginning to see some designers increasingly target this growing age group and develop fashion lines specifically for mature women that include professional apparel, party attire and attractive casual wear. For example, AARP recently profiled <a href=""http://blog.aarp.org/2012/08/14/affordable-clothes-women-50-plus/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Marla Wynne</a>, a designer who showcases her products on <a href=""http://www.hsn.com/shop/marlawynne-fashion/fa?view=all&amp;OrgRef=http://marlawynne.com/&amp;facet=6555"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Home Shopping Network</a> and says she targets the over-50 woman (but I must admit the model on her website looks quite young!).

One of the keys to dressing well after 50 is to make choices that are in the realm of classics. Banana Republic recently launched a line that is inspired by the 1960s drama ""Mad Men."" The reason it works is because modern takes on the classics never go out of style. And we all know fashion goes in cycles. That's certainly not to say that you need to dress in a boring way. Style, after all, is about capturing your personal essence. Cohen also told Vogue that many of his subjects - ""use their life experiences to inform their clothing choices"" - a context that provides a richer fashion statement that is trend-proof.

It just doesn't seem prudent to marginalize a group that practically rules the world. It's no secret that due to normal aging our bodies change - and no matter what our ""body type"" 50+ women look better in specific styles - so why not create a hip clothing line that's both fashionable AND functional for the 50+ woman of today. We can take these physical changes into account by choosing clothing that fits well and does not accentuate imperfections. In general, clothes should never be super tight (at any age!), but when worn should project clean lines and proper fit. If you're afraid of a fashion faux pas, shop with a stylish friend who delivers honest feedback.

If you can....treat yourself to tailored or custom-made clothing, but most importantly focus on quality and fit. It's your time to thrive and clothes that you feel great in will help you exude confidence. Most of all - have fun. As Ralph Lauren once said, ""Style is very personal. It has nothing to do with fashion. Fashion is over quickly. Style is forever.""",,"2018-09-10 13:16:50",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/fashion-for-older-people/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fashonable-woman-e1377204008858.jpg,"fashonable woman",,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fashonable-woman-e1377204008858.jpg,,Longevity,,"50|age|age group|clothing|cohen|fashion|group|lauren|look|men|model|reason|see|sense|style|stylish|time|vogue|woman|women",4,86,,,,,66,11026,fashion-after-50,"old people Fashion","Old People Fashion - Defining your personal style","There's no reason to not dress fashionably if you are over 50.

941,"How to Stay Socially Connected","As we age, we tend to become creatures of habit - even more so than we probably were in our younger days.  While routines are comforting, <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/04/16/120416crbo_books_heller"">research</a> tells us that one of the habits many of us adopt as we mature is the tendency to become disconnected with friends and family on a purely social<i> </i>level (as opposed to a sense of obligation or responsibility).  With that in mind, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/business/04unbox.html?_r=0"">brain researchers have discovered</a> that when we consciously develop new habits and activities we can actually jumpstart our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.  Reconnecting, and consequently becoming more socially active, may just do the trick!

A recent <a href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/business/prnewswire/index.ssf?/oregonlive/story/?catSetID=7002&amp;catID=290232&amp;nrid=186010502&amp;page=7"">survey</a> conducted on behalf of <a href=""http://www.vtechphones.com/careline"">VTech<i><sup>®</sup></i> Communications, Inc</a>. examined the issues facing caregivers and seniors as older adults strive to age independently. The research found that caregivers worried most about the time seniors were alone, while seniors missed an active social life. A total of 41 percent of seniors interviewed said that their top challenge was not being as active or social as they would like. This top concern overshadowed their worries about financial issues or other realities of aging.  This is truly groundbreaking information considering the media has always emphasized the size of our “nest egg” as we age and rarely considers the impact of social engagement.

Additional <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016701/"">research</a> also indicates that social disengagement and loneliness are often considered to be routinely associated with physical limitations causing us to become even more isolated.  I recently wrote a blog about the benefits of <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/livable-communities-of-the-future/"">livable communities</a> and making sure there are activities available that don’t require getting in a car and therefore enhance the opportunities for mature adults to be socially connected regardless of your current health status.

Unfortunately, staying socially connected isn’t as easy as just scheduling time. Even if you happen to have a lot of flexibility, your friends or family may not. So that said, schedule ahead and stick to a social calendar just like you would a work schedule. It takes a time investment to be social, but the rewards are immense.

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of staying socially connected:

1.)   <b>Pick up the phone:</b> It’s easy to email or comment on someone’s Facebook post, but how about going through your contact list and surprising someone with an actual phone call?  We all have easy access to make a call, but quite often we don’t actually reach out and spend the time to catch up. And now it is easier than ever with phones specifically designed for seniors, such as the <a href=""file:///C:\Users\Wes.Robinson\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary%20Internet%20Files\Content.Outlook\8J2M2S8V\vtechphones.com\careline"">CareLine phone system</a>.  In our digital age, hearing someone’s voice can be a refreshingly warm experience!

2.)   <b>Learn how to use Skype or FaceTime:</b> Free, easy and dependable video communication is widely available with just a tablet or even a smartphone. If you can video chat with your grandchildren every weekend, it’s a seamless way to catch up on their lives. These calls can be short and sweet, but just seeing your friends’ or loved ones’ faces can still be very satisfying.

3.)   <b>When spending time with someone, try to be in the moment:</b> Though you can’t actually <i>stretch</i> time, you can increase the quality of time if there’s nothing urgent scheduled. When you have the opportunity to meet a friend in person, make it a lengthy lunch date, a shopping trip or a day on the links. If you like baseball, nine innings are perfect for catching up.

4.)   <b>Connect with people who share a hobby:</b> Hobbies can be very enriching and relaxing. Being with other people who share your enthusiasm for gardening or antique cars is one of life’s simple pleasures. Having trouble finding like-minded folks in your area? Ask around at your local community center. You can also try online forums for your hobby or post a <a href=""http://www.meetup.com"">meet-up</a> in your area.

In addition, taking time to volunteer, exercise or get involved in a new field will open doors to socializing. My father has always been a gym enthusiast and in addition to his intense <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI53hyFNhW4"">weight training workouts</a>, he has a close-knit group at his health club that he sees on a regular basis. Working at a food co-op or animal shelter would be ideal for those looking for a regular activity that offers a tremendous opportunity to interact with others.  In the case of the animal shelter, extensive <a href=""http://www.todaysgeriatricmedicine.com/news/exclusive_06.shtml"">studies</a> have indicated that exposing older adults to animals reduces their sense of loneliness considerably.

During your <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/30-bonus-years/"">30 Bonus Years</a>, it’s an ideal time to get involved in a cause that you’ve always wanted to spend more time doing. Getting more hands-on and involved with an organization you may have financially supported over the years is great for your spirits.  Immersing yourself in a cause can also re-define your purpose in life and connect you with people that are from a younger (or older) generation.

I would be remiss if I did not mention that <a href=""http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/social-networking-for-seniors/?_r=0"">technology</a> does help keep older adults socially connected, especially if you live in a remote area. The key is to treat social media - or discussion forums - in a similar manner as if you’re having a conversation. Don’t just be a passive observer. Use private messaging, post your thoughts and start discussion threads – get involved in the rapport.

Social media is also an excellent way to socialize and reconnect with people from your past. Perhaps now is the time to say hello to someone who was an important influence in your life. Be sure to share how he or she made an impact. You might be surprised at how much that individual appreciates you having taken the time to reach out.  In my case, I recently ran across one of my high school teachers on Facebook, and she was shocked I remembered her. (Actually, I was more impressed she remembered me as the subject she taught was definitely not my best!)

There’s no doubt that taking the time to connect with people is essential for living well as you age.  You don’t grow as an individual if you simply disengage. By exposing yourself to people with different outlooks on life you can open up a whole new world. What are you waiting for?  Pick up the phone and call a friend or family member you haven’t seen in awhile and make a plan to get out of the house.",,"2020-11-11 17:37:36",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/staying-socially-connected/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Staying-Socially-Connected.jpg,"Staying Socially Connected",,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Staying-Socially-Connected.jpg,,Longevity,,"adults|age|animal shelter|call|connect with people|connected|involved|life|older adults|people|phone|pick up the phone|seniors|social|social media|socially|socially connected|staying socially|staying socially connected|time",4,86,,,,,75,16391,,"benefits of socializing for seniors","There are many benefits of socializing for seniors","As we get older, we tend to isolate ourselves.

950,"A Primary Caregiver’s Basic Toolkit","Currently there are more than 44 million people<a href=""http://www.caregiver.org""> providing care</a> for an aging loved one in the United States — nearly one in four households is involved in caring for a relative or friend aged 50 or older. It’s estimated that more than 80 million people in the U.S. will have two or more chronic conditions by the year 2020.

Serving as a caregiver for an aging loved one is no easy task. As our society continues to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_in_place"">age in place</a>, more and more Americans will find themselves in the demanding position of caring for an elderly parent or spouse. Proper preparation is key to being an effective caregiver while hopefully encountering less stress. Here are a few ideas to help make your caregiving experience as seamless as possible – while still having some fun!

<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Keep Moving:</span></b><b> </b>Although your aging loved one might not be in the physical shape that he or she once was, regular exercise is still a vital component of <a href=""http://www.helpguide.org/life/senior_fitness_sports.htm"">maintaining peak physical and mental fitness.</a> Physical benefits of exercise can include weight loss, reduced impact of illness, increased flexibility, mobility and balance. Regular exercise also can improve mental health by increasing self-confidence and improving sleep. Additionally, <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/how-exercise-may-boost-the-brain/"">regular exercise</a> is often linked to preventing memory loss and potentially slowing down the effects of brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Cycling, yoga or Pilates are just a few of the ways that mature adults can help maintain <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/exercise-for-seniors/"">healthy exercise routines</a>.

<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Outsource the Errands:</span></b><b> </b>Going to the store can be a major task – and very time consuming - for seniors and their caregivers. But, we all know that one of the best ways to ensure good health is by eating as much fresh (and unprocessed) food as possible. Restaurants tend to add more fats and sugars. My advice is to explore grocery delivery services such a <a href=""https://www.freshdirect.com/welcome.jsp"">Fresh Direct</a>, and if you’re searching for household items a great online resource is <a href=""http://www.soap.com/"">Soap.com</a>. The end cost is usually not exorbitant when considering your time and gas expenses. It’s always handy to plan ahead.

<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduce the Confusion:</span></b><b> </b>One problem that caregivers routinely run into is managing their loved ones’ medication schedules. Mature adults often find themselves in the hospital after forgetting to take or misusing a prescription. In fact, studies show that 1 in 10 senior hospital visits result from <a href=""http://cdc.gov/medicationsafety/basics.html"">medication errors</a>. Utilizing a system to help keep up with your loved one’s prescription schedule can be an easy way to avoid a medication error. The solution can be as low tech as keeping a prescription journal to keep up with medication dosages and times. <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/technology-must-haves-for-the-50-%E2%80%A8/"">More tech-savvy solutions </a>include the reminders through pharmacy mobile apps and home based medication dispensers.

<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Stay In Touch:</span> </b>A phone is not only an important tool for helping an aging loved one maintain his or her independence, it’s also a vital part of socialization and connectivity. Communicating with friends and family is critical in terms of engaging in an active lifestyle while simultaneously holding onto important relationships. For older adults, and their caregivers, products like the <a href=""http://www.vtechphones.com/careline"">VTech CareLine</a><sup>TM</sup> home telephone and personal communication system enables them to live independent lifestyles and gives families confidence in their loved ones’ ability to easily stay connected.

<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Live a Little:</span></b><b> </b>Listening to music can reduce stress and promote happiness. Fortunately a lot of us grew up with music that our parents love, so it’s easier to find common ground. Online music services such as <a href=""https://www.spotify.com/us/video-splash/?utm_source=spotify&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=start"">Spotify</a> and <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/"">Pandora</a> are easy ways to access a wide range of choices in most genres. Movies also allow us to bond and escape into another world. <a href=""https://signup.netflix.com/"">Netflix</a> offers unlimited viewing at a low subscription rate. The digital age allows us to have instant access to entertainment in the comfort of our homes. Taking the time to plan some programming for your loved one will be much appreciated.

<b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Always Be Prepared:</span></b><b> </b>An open line of communication during the caregiver journey is an important tool. When caring for an aging person, there are plenty of important decisions that must be made. Making sure you include the person you’re caring for in conversations regarding business, medication, treatment and living arrangements is extremely important to ensure that your loved one is receiving everything he or she needs <i>and </i>wants. Communication also is key when it comes to being prepared. Talk to the person you are caring for and make sure all <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/5-legal-documents-you-need-for-your-parents/"">important documents</a>, such as revocable living trusts, wills or medical directives, have been completed and find out where they are filed.<b></b>",,"2020-10-31 00:43:11",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/a-caregivers-basic-toolkit/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Caregiver-Toolkit.jpg,"Caregiver Toolkit",,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Caregiver-Toolkit.jpg,,Caregiving,,"adults|aging|aging loved|caregiver|caregivers|caring|communication|exercise|find|help|important tool|include|loved|mature adults|medication|music|physical|prescription|regular exercise|time",4,86,,,,,77,4489,,"caregiver tools","Basic caregiver tools in a kit - essential items for the caregiver","If you have basic caregiver tools, a well-organized plan can go a long way.

951,"Keep Your Parents Independent","As we reach middle age and beyond, most of us have some degree of <a href=""http://www.arthritis.org"">osteoarthritis</a> (OA) – pain and stiffness caused by the breakdown of cartilage that normally cushions our joints.  According to the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), about 27 million people in the United States have OA and that number is expected to grow to 40 million by 2020.

While OA, often simply referred to as arthritis, can affect almost any joint, for many people, the joints in the hands are hit the hardest.  As a result, gripping, grabbing and holding objects with one’s hands can be difficult.  OA of the hands and other problems, including strokes and neuropathy (nerve damage), can affect one’s ability to do many normal daily tasks like dressing, combing hair, preparing foods and engaging in hobbies.

There are simple and low-cost modifications you and your aging loved ones can do to make these activities easier on sore, stiff or less-than-nimble hands.  Try a few of the following tips to help foster your parent’s independence – you might just be surprised how much easier they make every day tasks!

<strong>Build it up. </strong> In order to make handles of products easier to hold, build them up with materials you have at your disposal.  Electrical or adhesive tape will work for the handles of most hairbrushes, pots and pans and small gardening tools.  Those sponge curlers your mom used when she was younger work great over the handles of silverware, toothbrushes, small paintbrushes, pencils, etc.  You can also purchase <a href=""http://www.farmandfleet.com/products/324531-m-d-building-products-polyethylene-tube-pipe-insulation.html?utm_medium=shoppingengine&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;gclid=COGR9Z2tnLgCFQqf4Aod520AGQ#.UdjUrz5ARJU"">pipe tubing</a> from your local hardware store.  This material will slide easily over any utensils or items that have a handle, making the handle easier to grip.  The neoprene in the tubing will also help prevent the item from slipping out of your parent’s hands if they’re wet. It’s also very pliable, and therefore easier to use if you’re dealing with a variety of different handle sizes.

<strong>Get rid of the barriers.</strong>  If your parent has trouble buttoning clothing, encourage him or her to buy clothes that pull over, pull up or zip.  For blouses and shirts already in the closet, remove the buttons and sew up the buttonholes.  Then sew the button over the buttonhole so that it shows on the front of the garment.  Finally, sew Velcro squares beneath the buttons.  To make zippers easier to zip, place a thin loop of fabric or yarn through the hole and tie the two ends together.  That way your loved one can more easily pull the zipper up by placing a finger through the loop, eliminating the need to grip the tiny metal zipper.  If your parent is in a hurry to get dressed and you don’t have a loop of string handy, try a large safety pin.  If he or she is buying new clothes this popular “popover shirt” from <a href=""http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/oxfordshirts/PRDOVR~65932/65932.jsp"">J. Crew</a> looks very much like a traditional oxford shirt, but it’s much easier to put on for someone with OA.

<strong>Help your parent use the strongest muscles. </strong> If your parent has difficulty opening drawers, cabinets or even the refrigerator door, try placing fabric loops through drawer pulls and door handles.  When your loved one is ready to open them, he or she can place a hand and arm through the loop and pull with the forearm.  Traditional <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bandanas-By-The-Dozen-12-Pack/dp/B00C814WCQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373164864&amp;sr=1-1"">bandanas</a> are a great resource, and they are both strong and washable.  Anyone suffering from sore joints in the hands should also be <strong>using lightweight dishes. </strong> The stoneware your mother got as a wedding gift may be a little hard to carry now!  Help save her hand joints by getting her some <a href=""http://www.corelle.com/impressions"">lightweight dishes</a> – plastic works great and won’t break even if it’s dropped.

<strong>Look for texture and spare the fingers. </strong> When shopping for glassware or items with handles, look for texture.  Bumpy, rigid, rough or rubberized surfaces are usually easier to grip than slick ones – look for <a href=""http://www.target.com/p/textured-tumbler-set-of-4/-/A-14415357"">textured tumblers</a>.  The same items can be useful to help prevent slipping and breaking if their hands are wet or they’ve just applied lotion.  If typing or pressing the buttons on a phone or microwave is difficult, suggest your parent use the eraser end of a pencil to do the job.  If you want to make phone calls super easy, <a href=""http://www.vtechphones.com/careline"">VTech</a> has a line of phones and communications devices called CareLine that is very senior-friendly with large buttons, Voice Announce® Caller ID and one-button emergency calling through a wearable pendant.  If your parent uses a computer for email or letter writing, voice recognition software can also enable him or her to compose copy without having to key it in.

<strong>Open up and go topless. </strong> If your parent has difficulty opening plastic or cellophane packages such as the kind crackers, cereal or sandwich meats come in, open the packages yourself and transfer the contents into a <a href=""http://www.bagbarn.com"">""zipable""</a> plastic bag or plastic container so that your parent can open and close it easily when he or she is ready to use the product.  For pretzels or chips, open the bag, fold down the top and close it with a chip clip that is readily available at supermarkets and discount stores.  Removing the top from spray deodorant, shaving cream, hair spray and aerosol cleaning products, such as bathroom cleaner or furniture polish, can be difficult for anyone.  If your parent uses these products, remove the tops and store the cans “topless.”  Another option is to purchase non-aerosol products such as roll-on or stick deodorant, pump hairspray or pre-treated dusting or<a href=""http://www.clorax.com/products/clorax-disinfecting-wipes""> disinfecting wipes</a>.

<strong>Think small.</strong>  Economy-size jugs of milk, laundry detergent or bottles of dish liquid may cost less than getting the equivalent amount in several smaller containers, but when gripping (and lifting) is a problem, smaller packages may be a better idea.  When shopping for your parent, look for small <a href=""http://www.crateandbarrel.com/small-milk-bottle/s187651?a=1552&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype="">easy-to-grip containers</a>.  If he or she insists on large packages to save money, transfer the contents to smaller containers when you get the groceries home.  Also pick easy-to-open bottles.  If there are no children in the home, forego the childproof prescription bottles, which can be hard on stiff hands and sore joints.  Also, ask the pharmacist to put prescriptions in an easy-to-open <a href=""http://sabi.com/squeeze.html"">medication dispenser</a>.

In fact, according to <a href=""http://www.aarp.org"">AARP</a>, most baby boomers report that they feel online classes fit very nicely within their busy schedules and satisfy their desire to learn at their own speed.  Instead of raising your hand, you can grab the teacher’s attention with a click of the mouse!  In addition, very often you will be in the ‘ether class’ with much younger students and it’s a great opportunity to <i>match wits</i> with a different generation.

There are so many options out there – if learning to program in Dreamweaver is your idea of fun - <a href=""http://www.lynda.com"">www.lynda.com</a> can get you up and running in just a few weeks.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"">YouTube</a> is a fantastic source in terms of finding a plethora of “How-To” v-blogs that will introduce you to subjects you probably never dreamed of learning about – for instance, the how to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfvtkXCojL0&amp;list=PL1F240EA7DB489D19&amp;index=1"">make fake poop</a> video has over 2.5 million views – might come in handy with the grandkids - <i>just sayin’</i>!  (Did you click over to the video – it’s actually not as gross as it sounds).  But I digress…..

Baby boomers have lead the pack in terms of entrepreneurial pursuits over the last decade – if that has always been your dream perhaps it will only take a few online tutorials to take you to the next level.  For instance, <a href=""http://www.entreprenuer.com/howto/startyourbiz.html"">www.entreprenuer.com</a> offers a great set of blogs and videos for people who want to start a new business.  Life experience provides a unique insight into what works and what may not - being able to spot and forecast trends based on past experience certainly gives boomers a leg up in business!

One of the keys to success with online education is to tap into something that you’re already passionate about - or feel you may have a knack for in terms of picking it up with ease.  For instance, the website <a href=""http://www.encore.org"">www.encore.org</a> is a great resource for people who want to start a new ""cause related"" career.  Their motto is “<i>leave the world better than you found it</i>.”  Don’t you just LOVE that philosophy!  This mindset can drive you to make money <i>and</i> help others, which might empower you to reignite your sense of purpose.  Turn your passion into profit!

If it’s a hobby you strive to capture online there are plenty of resources for that pursuit as well.  Learning how to <a href=""http://www.nybg.org/plant-talk/2013/04/adult-education/urban-container-gardening-classes/"">garden</a>, <a href=""http://www.finewoodworking.com/how-to/article/woodworking-schools-directory.aspx"">craft furniture</a> or <a href=""http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/surf-schools/"">surf</a> is well within reach these days.  Perhaps you’ve always loved music but never had the chance to learn how to <a href=""http://www.discoverahobby.com/learn/singing"">sing</a> or <a href=""http://www.virtualmusicalinstruments.com"">play an instrument</a>.  If you want to write, free blogging tools such as Blogger or Wordpress allow you to self publish and build your audience.  Oh wait – we can’t forget my Mom….let’s add <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SQWJQechA"">belly dancing</a> to her <b>‘mastered it’</b> list above!

<strong>Q. My husband just retired and he seems incredibly bored! Can you suggest something adventurous that we could do together outside of the regular ""keep busy activities"" that everyone always recommends?</strong>

A. This is a very common question -- believe me, you're not alone in wondering what to do with your spouse after they've retired. Why not try going on a volunteer vacation together?<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CLbg5pJbM"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">""Voluntourism""</a> is one of the fastest-growing segments of the travel industry and it's about seeing the world from a firsthand perspective, rather than as a passive tourist looking through a window. It's very economical and it allows you to experience a country that you want to visit while working, eating and living with the local residents. Not only do you get to travel and see the world, but you will also be making a difference (""doing well by doing good"")! You can find the top volunteer vacations online at websites like <a href=""http://www.roadscholar.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.road scholar.org</a>, <a href=""http://www.globalvolunteers.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.globalvolunteers.org</a> and <a href=""http://www.earthwatch.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.earthwatch.org</a>. Safe Travels!

<strong>Q. I'm over 60 and sometimes when I go out I feel ""out of style""... What exactly is 'age appropriate' clothing, and do I need to adopt a certain midlife fashion style?</strong>

A. There's no reason to stop caring about fashion after a certain age. Instead of resigning yourself to so-called <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/fashion-for-older-people/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">'age-appropriate'</a> clothing, why not start developing your own sense of style at 60 and beyond? Now is the time to explore fashion and learn more about style icons like Jackie Onassis, Jane Birkin or Audrey Hepburn. We frequently see woman over 60, such as actress Diane Keaton and model Lauren Hutton, continue to outclass younger starlets because they have remained consistently stylish with clothing that is not only perfect for their age, but also possesses a look that suits their personalities.

<strong>Q. I love to exercise, but sometimes, my arthritis gets the best of me! Can you recommend some low impact exercises that will help me stay fit?</strong>

A. There is no doubt that joint-jarring activities like aerobics and kickboxing are giving way to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OQQC6kYhmU"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gentler pursuits</a> for people, like you, who have a chronic condition. In your case, I suggest you look into pilates, yoga, tai chi, elliptical trainers and exercise bikes. I recently posted an article about engaging in these types of <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/exercise-for-seniors"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">exercises</a>. Whatever you choose, keep exercising <strong>regularly</strong>! With heart disease, cancer and strokes serving as the leading causes of death for mature adults, staying physically active not only helps to prevent many illnesses, it can improve the health of people who already have debilitating diseases or disabilities. Just a reminder, make sure you check with your physician before you begin any new exercise routine.

<strong>Q. I will be 62 this year and I'm working part-time, can I apply for Social Security benefits?</strong>

A. You can apply as early as 62 for these benefits, but the amount you receive each month will be less than if you wait until full retirement (also called ""normal retirement age""). If you want to keep working while collecting Social Security, your payments may be reduced depending on the amount you earn from your job. Once you reach full retirement age, there is no limit on the amount you can earn from working while collecting Social Security benefits. For more information on estimating your potential benefit amounts using different retirement dates and levels of future earnings, visit <a href=""http://www.socialsecurity.gov/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.socialsecurity.gov</a> or call 800-772-1213.

<strong>Q. My aging mother-in-law still lives in the house that she grew up in. The house has very steep stairs, a small doorway and is not <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/home-safety-for-seniors-2/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">""senior-friendly.""</a> My husband and I want to help her move to a retirement community, but she's scared - how can we ease the transition for her?</strong>

A. Having just moved to a different home -- I completely understand how she feels -- moving (especially when you're <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/downsizing-aging-loved-home/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">downsizing</a>) is something that is very hard for all us and it can be even more difficult for someone who has lived in a particular neighborhood or house for a lifetime! But fear not, there are specially-trained ""senior relocation specialists"" who focus on helping older adults move with ease. They start with a pre-move consultation to help come up with a plan as to the best items to keep and those your aging loved one might consider leaving behind. The specialist makes it a very positive experience for the individual involved and makes sure they bring all of their sentimental belongings to their new home. The specialist then sets the older adult up in the new home and creates a look and feel as similar as possible to their previous home. This helps make the individual ""feel at home."" If you go online and google ""senior relocation specialists"" you will find a helpful resource in your mother-in-laws area.

<strong>Q. I've noticed my Mom has gotten a bit forgetful lately. I told her that she didn't need to worry too much and that it was just a natural part of aging. Am I right?</strong>

A. Age-related changes in cognition can sometimes make it harder to learn and remember certain things. Memory problems that aren't usually considered to be a part of ""normal aging"" include: forgetting things much more often than you used to, having trouble learning new things, repeating phrases or stories in the same conversation and having trouble making routine choices or handling money. I would definitely suggest that you have your mother discuss her memory problems with her physician to make sure she is properly diagnosed. One decision that everyone, especially mature adults, should stick to is the promise to keep our minds sharp throughout our lives. Researchers call this lifelong process<a href=""https://www.cognifit.com/science/cognitive-vitality-key"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">""cognitive vitality.""</a>

<strong>Q. My Dad spends a lot of time alone, he calls me 24/7 and he constantly wants me to come visit. I've been thinking about getting him a pet -- do you think this is a good idea?</strong>

A. Having a pet can offer a sense of well-being, encouragement and even a reason for living. Being responsible for another life often gives new meaning to the lives of those who are living alone or who have experienced a loss. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn9b5w-FpOo"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Research</a> indicates that caring for and providing a loving home to an animal companion will also encourage your father to remain active and stay healthy.

However, I strongly suggest that you don't surprise your father with a pet. Instead, discuss the idea with him and see if he's open to it, go pet shopping together so you can help him consider the costs, responsibilities and his lifestyle when making the decision! For more information about adopting a pet, visit the Humane Society of the United States at:<a href=""http://www.hsus.org/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.hsus.org</a> or call (202) 452-1100.

<strong>Q. I just visited my older sister who is recently widowed and she seems so different. She appears to have lost weight, she says she isn't sleeping very well and she isn't her usual happy and energetic self. Should I be concerned?</strong>

A. Obviously the grieving period after a loss is very individual and the transition to her new life may require significant downtime. With that being said, you should definitely take these changes seriously as the symptoms you have described could be signs of depression. Depression is a medical illness and no one should be ashamed of the associated symptoms it may present. <a href=""http://www.helpguide.org/mental/depression_elderly.htm"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Research</a> indicates that seniors may be prone to depression as they have many losses in their lives - family, friends, etc. I would encourage her to talk about her feelings as this can help her understand why she is feeling this way. It is also important that she see a physician who can ascertain if she's clinically depressed.

977,"50+ Friendly Fitness Gadgets & Apps","Getting into the groove to exercise is tough, but what if you had a gadget that held you accountable while instantaneously making the experience more fun (<em>ok that may be pushing it…</em>)?  Whether your idea of a fitness program is walking around your neighborhood, exercising in your basement or working out at the gym, new high-tech gadgets and smart phone apps make it possible for you to design, follow and track your progress while completing an exercise program designed to meet <b><i>your</i></b> specific needs.

Key indicators like bone mass, range of motion and cardiovascular fitness can now be easily measured without ever visiting your physician (<em>although I do suggest you talk to your doctor before starting any new workout regime!</em>).  Innovative devices on the market now take into account just about any health problems that could limit certain types or intensity levels of exercise. One interesting product, the <a href=""http://www.lark.com/products/larklife/experience"">Larklife</a> fitness tracker, can even sense if you’ve had a good night’s sleep and recommends ways to “up your energy level once you’re awake.”  Easy accessibility to these products allows you to create your own personal training program on the fly – even when you’re on the road.  There are ‘smart’ <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/08/iriver-valencell-on/"">headphones </a> that give you biometric measurements, <a href=""http://www.mybasis.com"">wristbands</a> that monitor your heart rate and even an HD camera built into your <a href=""http://www.zealoptics.com/hdcameragoggle.html"">ski goggles</a> (<em>just in case you want ""relive"" that black diamond experience to prep for the next run!</em>).

Clearly, tracking your health and wellness progress has never been easier and it’s most definitely ‘in vogue’ these days when it comes to the increasingly athletic baby boomer world.  One example of innovative advancements in fitness is showcased via “smart card” technology - it supplies a gym member with a specific exercise regimen that is programmed into the card.  Here’s how it works…when the card is swiped on a specially equipped piece of exercise equipment, the machine remembers the member’s last workout. The device’s memory includes personal settings - such as weight, age and gender - and it also adjusts factors for speed, resistance and number of reps.  The assumption is that healthcare insurers will potentially utilize the “smart card” concept to track whether people are following a prescribed exercise program and possibly penalize them if they’re not. Hopefully, insurers will <strong><em>also</em></strong> be kind enough to use it to reward people who do exercise regularly (<em>so get off the couch folks</em>!).

Here are a few more innovative and practical gadgets out there to help you put a little fun into your workout:

The <a href=""http://www.striiv.com/"">Strivv pedometer</a> not only counts your daily walking steps, it sets up challenges for your routine and lets you earn points for your achievements.  The folks at Strivv design personalized challenges tailored to your activity levels, and turn 10,000 steps a day into playing a game, donating to charity and competing with friends.

For practical health, <a href=""http://www.fitbit.com/aria"">Fitbit’s Aria scale</a> doesn’t just measure your weight (which isn’t the <i>truest </i>measure of health) – it also measures body mass index and body fat, which are more revealing.  The information is transmitted wirelessly to your computer and assists in making sure you are on track to reach your goals.

Creativity keeps things interesting with the <a href=""https://www.zombiesrungame.com/"">Zombies, Run!</a> smartphone app. As you run or walk, the narrator gives instructions to dodge zombies and other threats.  Novelist Naomi Alderman provides the storyline here – their website says “<em>you will go on an epic adventure that motivates you to run further and faster than ever before.</em>”

Swimming is one of the best activities you can do for your body!  It’s quite easy on the joints and works nearly every muscle....<em>all the while taxing your heart and lungs</em>. There’s also a very meditative rhythm to swimming steady laps which is very peaceful.  But...no doubt - even swimming can get boring at times. Thankfully, there are the fully submersible <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/FINIS-SwiMP3-2G-X18-Firmware/dp/B00822529W/ref=sr_1_cc_1/?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369748846&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=neptune+headphones&amp;tag=hptech-21"">FiNIS SwiMP3 headphones</a> that transmit music through your cheekbones (<em>you can also listen to audiobook and podcasts if you're swimming long distances!</em>).

990,"60 Yr. Old Hipsters Move to the City","A recent <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324136204578644080452044960.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>Wall Street Journal</em> article</a> documented the trend around boomers moving into neighborhoods and real estate projects aimed to appeal to ultra-cool young adults.

The story featured corporate executive Jennifer Williams, 52, who moved from the tony Upper East Side of Manhattan to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, aka hipster central, where raw denim and single-sourced coffee beans rule. She told the <em>Journal</em>, “I find [Williamsburg] endlessly fascinating and interesting. I wanted to be somewhere with energy and life.”

What’s happening is that boomers have the money and the freedom to downsize and upgrade to thriving metropolises. In fact, they are a fiercely independent generation that formed their free-thinking ways during the Sexual Revolution, touring with the Dead and the golden era of American filmmaking. Boomers were the original hipster generation before it became an everlasting subculture parodied on shows like The IFC Channel’s “Portlandia.”

I’m all for this migration to the city. First of all, the health benefits are amazing: more walking and fresh vegetables at the farmers market, locally grown everything – not to mention the antioxidant-packed single-source Arabica beans. Besides everyone around you will have heard that NPR segment on the dangers of fracking and you will probably be able to find that vinyl copy of the Dead “Live Cornell 1977” that’s been missing in your collection.

Kidding about liberal boomer stereotypes aside, this trend towards urban living among boomers is changing the real estate market with even massive sized builders like Toll Bros. focusing on the city living.

<em><a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-09/local/41222111_1_boomers-generation-city-life"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Washington Post</a></em> reports that empty nesters, no longer captive to high-ranking school districts and big yards with swing sets, now want to be close to fine dining, upscale retail and public transportation. In the last decade the reverse migration to cities has been increasing according to reports from major brokerage firms.

I’ve written in the past about <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/livable-communities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">livable communities</a>, and this move to hip cities is in line with my <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/30-bonus-years/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">30 Bonus Years</a> way of thinking.

995,"Are You Staying Mentally Sharp?","Even if you’re experiencing a troublesome level of memory loss, there are many things you can do to learn new information and retain it.  The same practices that contribute to healthy aging and physical vitality also contribute to a healthy memory.  When it comes to memory, it’s definitely smart to adopt the familiar adage “use it or lose it.”   Just as <i>physical</i> exercise can keep your body strong, <i>mental</i> exercise can help make your mind function better and lower your risk of mental decline.  Here are some great tips to help you and your aging loved ones maintain healthy brains and consequently healthy lives!
<p align=""center""><b><i><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tips to Help Prevent Memory Loss and Cognitive Decline</span></i></b></p>

<ul>
	<li><b style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exercise Regularly with Kinder, Gentler Routines</span></b></li>
</ul>
Regular exercise boosts brain growth factors and encourages the development of new brain cells.  Exercise also reduces the risk for disorders that lead to memory loss, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Baby boomers are fueling the exercise trend toward kinder, gentler workouts. Fitness experts suggest that the ideal routine combines the strength, flexibility and balance training of yoga and Pilates with an aerobic activity such as brisk walking.  I recently posted a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlL314y0s40"">video interview</a> with the founder of the International Council on Active Aging, Colin Milner, about the benefits of exercise and staying active as we age – it’s full of great information!  Whatever exercise program you decide to embrace, remember to always check with your physician before you begin.
<ul>
	<li><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Stay Social and Maintain Your Relationships</span></b></li>
</ul>
People who don’t have social contact with family and friends are at a higher risk for memory problems than people who have strong social ties.  <a href=""http://www.4abettermemory.com/memory/?p=222"">Social interaction</a> helps the brain function in numerous ways: it often involves activities/conversations that challenge the mind and it naturally helps ward off stress and depression.  When it comes to staying engaged, products like the <a href=""http://www.vtechphones.com/careline"">VTech CareLine</a><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><sup>TM</sup></span> home telephone and personal communication system enables you to live an independent lifestyle and gives your family confidence that they can stay connected with ease.  So join a book club, reconnect with old friends, visit the local gym or pick up the phone.  Conversing with other people and staying engaged will help keep your mind sharp!
<ul>
	<li><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Eat Plenty of Fruits, Vegetables and Omega-3 Fats</span></b></li>
</ul>
Antioxidants, found in abundance in fresh produce, help keep your brain cells from rusting.  And foods rich in omega-3 fats (such as salmon, tuna, trout, walnuts and flaxseed) are particularly good for your brain and memory.  Try not to be<i> too </i>strict – otherwise eating properly just becomes another form of stress – just try to keep<a href=""http://www.discovergoodnutrition.com/2011/03/5-healthy-eating-tips-to-reduce-stress""> meals simple, nutritious and fresh.</a>  But do be careful – a new study suggests that <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/241570.php""><i>overeating</i></a><i> </i>in older people may double their risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a term that describes the stage between the memory loss that normally comes with aging and that seen in early Alzheimer's disease.  And (<i>obviously!</i>) don’t smoke!  Smoking heightens the risk of vascular disorders that can lead to a stroke and constricts arteries that deliver oxygen to the brain.
<ul>
	<li><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Manage Your Stress and Get Some Sleep</span></b></li>
</ul>
When you’re stressed out, you’re more likely to suffer memory lapses and have trouble learning and concentrating.  Cortisol, the stress hormone, damages the brain over time and can lead to memory problems.  Get plenty of sleep!  According to <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-deprivation-effects-on-memory"">WebMD</a>, if you’re sleep deprived, you’re at risk of developing a number of serious health problems, such as <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm"">hypertension</a>, <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/diet/what-is-obesity"">obesity</a> and <a href=""http://diabetes.webmd.com/default.htm"">diabetes</a>, and your ability to learn and retain new information may be impaired.  Sleep is necessary for memory consolidation, the process of forming and storing new memories so you can retrieve them later. Sleep deprivation also reduces the growth of new neurons in the hippocampus and causes problems with memory, concentration and decision-making.  Unfortunately, reduced sleep can also eventually lead to depression - another memory killer.

If you want to stay sharp and in control of your life well into your golden years, there are proactive methods to achieving the mental alertness you need.  More and more research is pointing to the fact that physical activity and lifestyle choices have more to do with preventing Alzheimer s disease and other forms of dementia – once thought to be a normal part of aging – than pure genetics.  Face it, as we get older our minds tend to lose their sharpness.  We start forgetting things, like people's names or what item was next on our mental to do list.  But aging doesn't have to be synonymous with a dull brain – get out there and use it before you lose it!

1001,"Is Aging in Place the Right Choice?","<a href=""http://www.ageinplace.org"">Aging in place </a>refers to the ability for seniors to live in their own homes, wherever that may be, for as long as they are independent and safe.  With so many older adults planning to age in place, it’s important to know that a wide range of information, services and products are available to make staying at home a viable option.

Along with aging in place, universal design is becoming more of a household term. <a title=""A Case for Universal Design"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BngijcXPq_k"">Universal design</a> is the creation of environments and products that are meant to be used by all people to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialization.  Essentially, it’s about building or modifying places and spaces—both public and private—to accommodate people of all ages and abilities.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYbW4Nrsdis?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Below are a few questions (and answers!) to consider when determining if aging in place, and creating a universally designed space, is the right choice for you and your aging loved one in the long term.

<b>Is Their Home Safe?</b>  No one can remain completely independent for long in a home that cannot sustain him or her safely.  If your loved one’s home is unsafe, it’s important to be proactive and make modifications/repairs or find a new residence nearby that better meets his or her needs.  If your parents need <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/home-safety-for-seniors-2/"">home modifications</a> today, it’s worth starting projects now <i>before</i> they are definitely required for safety purposes.

<b>Can They Communicate with Ease?</b>  Many adult children live hundreds of miles from their parents.  Phone calls and Skype chats are useful to make sure they (and their homes) are in good shape.  For seniors and their caregivers, <a href=""http://www.vtechphones.com/careline"">VTech’s CareLine<sup>TM</sup></a> home telephone and personal communication system enables seniors to live independent lifestyles and gives families confidence in their loved ones’ ability to easily connect with them.

<b>Are They Mobile?</b>  Few steps are more symbolic of the loss of independence than giving up one’s car keys.  If your loved one can <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/safe-driving-tips-for-seniors/"">no longer drive</a>, he or she may face isolation and the loss of access to regular activities - potentially disrupting routines and leading to reduced mobility.  You can help make sure the loss of a car doesn’t mean a loss of engagement by arranging alternative transportation options.  The<a href=""http://www.seniordriving.aaa.com""> American Automobile Association</a> (AAA) and <a href=""https://aarpdriversafety.org"">AARP</a> both have great tips for older drivers.  Help parents scout such services now, before they’re needed.

<b>Are Resources Readily Available?</b>  Most towns have local grocery stores that deliver – Peapod.com is a national service that delivers from local stores.  Many drugstores also deliver prescriptions without a fee and <a href=""http://www.drugstore.com"">Drugstore.com</a> can ship a large variety of products to your aging loved one overnight.  If you don’t have a local store that delivers, netgrocer.com is a backup, although shipping is quite expensive.  <a href=""http://www.nowaa.org"">Meals on Wheels</a> is also a great resource – they will bring your loved one a hot meal every day.

If you’re still not sure if this is a good option for your loved one you might consider hiring a <a href=""http://ageinplace.com/aging-in-place-professionals/certified-aging-in-place-specialists-caps/"">Certified Aging in Place Specialist</a> to evaluate their current home and community and make proper recommendations – believe me it will be well worth the money spent!  Most older adults I speak with, hands-down, say that they wish to remain in their home forever.  With proper planning it’s possible, in many cases, for that dream to become a reality!

1003,"Dr. Alexis Approved: Claris Companion","As much as the Apple iPad and other tablet devices cater to intuitive use, the <a href=""http://www.clariscompanion.com/"">Claris Companion</a> is specifically designed to help older people with day-to-day tasks as well as with emergency situations. The Canadian company Claris Healthcare has created a device that is a smart way to keep in close touch with your aging loved ones.

I immediately noticed the design of the Claris Companion with its easy-to-use interface that takes cues from retro products such as the Etch A Sketch. Large buttons on the screen (with labels such as Call Me, Check In, Events, Messages, Photos and Exercises) are highly visible. So in addition to reminders to take medicine or ask the pharmacist to call, the Companion allows older people to text message, email, share photos – all the fun stuff. This is without having to download apps or update software and all that other fuss (like passwords) that seniors really don’t want to deal with.

<a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/xPVc2k5-WcLLFTqMHkX21HR8xRT5gk5egNePAOInx4Y.jpeg""><img class=""alignleft  wp-image-1005"" alt=""xPVc2k5-WcLLFTqMHkX21HR8xRT5gk5egNePAOInx4Y"" src=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/xPVc2k5-WcLLFTqMHkX21HR8xRT5gk5egNePAOInx4Y-373x280.jpeg"" width=""218"" height=""164"" /></a>

This device is well thought out and takes into consideration all the potential roadblocks seniors may encounter with technology. Even some tech-savvy folks I know have trouble setting up a plug-and-play Apple TV, so those who weren’t always surrounded by tech toys will appreciate the ultra simplicity of the Companion.

You can help the Companion owner setup his or her device through a secure website. So even if your loved one is thousands of miles away, you can set up this tablet.

""We're living in an age when most people use some form of digital technology to communicate and keep on top of their own medical care, whether it's email, text, or online services,"" said Geof Auchinleck, co-founder and CEO of Claris Healthcare. ""Unfortunately many seniors are left out of conversations because they're not comfortable with, or unable to use technology. This can lead to social isolation and medical issues.""

Auchinleck created the Companion with the needs of his 93-year-old mother in mind. If the person who uses it doesn’t have WiFi access, the company offers a 4G networked version. The cost of the Companion is $549 (with a $39/month subscription data plan) for the WiFi version and $649 (with a $49/month subscription data plan) for the cellular 4G model.

What I especially like is that the Companion doesn’t skimp on quality where it counts. Real bamboo, a simple charging station and amplified speakers make for a nice package at a reasonable price point. Smart design, pleasing esthetics and a strong value are the qualities that make the Claris Companion <a href=""alexisabramson.com:dr-alexis-approved"">Dr. Alexis Approved</a>.",,"2013-09-04 12:37:33",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=1003,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bjIsbHWmwsSBdRPRYzd7-R6iELXBTnjZ8BeXWZvWqbc.jpeg,bjIsbHWmwsSBdRPRYzd7-R6iELXBTnjZ8BeXWZvWqbc,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bjIsbHWmwsSBdRPRYzd7-R6iELXBTnjZ8BeXWZvWqbc.jpeg,,Lifestyle,,,4,86,,,,,83,2863,,"Claris Companion","Dr. Alexis Approved: Claris Companion","Claris Companion is a tablet device designed for older people to use as a way to keep in touch with loved ones as well as keep track of medications.",,,1004,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",claris-companion,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 18:09:09",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""I wanted to do this swim, this endeavor, not to just beat the athletic record,"" Nyad, 64, said to the press corps. ""I wanted it to be a lesson for my life that says, <em>be fully engaged</em>.""

So what can we take away from Nyad’s journey so that we all become more “fully engaged” in our own lives ?

1015,"5 Boomer Bands You Must See Live","<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">(The Rolling Stones are pictured here playing a show this year at The Glastonbury Festival)</span>

The problem with rockers is that they often die young – case in point - Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. But fortunately many remain ‘forever young’ and are still touring steadily. When The Who played a halftime show at the 2009 Super Bowl, many people were surprised at how energetic the show was. If you’re thinking of taking in a live show, consider these acts.

1.)   <b>Prince:</b> The ultimate performer who can play nearly every instrument on a rock stage.  Prince is still a crowd favorite who brings surprise guests on stage and doesn’t shy away from tearing up classics from old albums like “Purple Rain.”

2.)   <b>The Allman Brothers Band:</b> These Southern rockers celebrated their 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2009 and with Derek Trucks and Warren Hayes in the lineup the legendary band hasn’t wavered from performing live. Due to their impromptu jam sessions on classics like “Blue Sky,” “Jessica” or “Revival,” you get a fresh show each time.

3.)   <b>The Rolling Stones:</b> Stones fans are appreciative that they are still relevant and playing live shows around the world. Mixed reviews about performances have popped up recently, but when these guys play a song like “Wild Horses,” the legend lives on.

4.)    <b>Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band:</b> Unfortunately Clarence Clemons has left us, but there are still plenty of reasons to see The Boss in concert if you haven’t already. The incredible live show has never slowed down and who can ever tire of hearing their classics “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” and “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.”

5.)   <b>Bob Dylan or Neil Young</b> (depending on your style): Surely polarizing figures among rock fans, but there’s no doubt these guys are storytellers who can paint a portrait with song. You might not be able to catch either of them for long so make a point of checking out a concert.","The problem with rockers is that they often die young.

1019,"What Yoga Can do for Longevity","Cast aside your notions that yoga is for a certain type of person. Perhaps you picture Birkenstock-wearing, farmers’ market-shopping types finding their inner peace. Actually yoga predates any of these modern stereotypes and evidence of its practice dates as far back a 3000 B.C. - clearly people have understood the mental and physical health benefits for a long time.

Why am I recommending yoga? As we age the effects of compounded stress can be extremely taxing on our overall health. Yoga, with its poses and focus on breathing, can begin to relieve stress, which can then hopefully lessen the risk of heart conditions. Yoga, practiced with consistency, has been linked to lower blood pressure according to a <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20130515/yoga-may-help-ease-high-blood-pressure-study-finds"">study</a> from the University of Pennsylvania.

<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/203693571"">Successful Longevity</a> from <a href=""https://vimeo.com/alexisabramson"">Alexis Abramson, PhD</a> on <a href=""https://vimeo.com"">Vimeo</a>.</p>
The most commonly seen form of Yoga is called Hatha, which is based on a series of poses called Asanas. Holding these poses and working on controlled breathing yields immediate tangible benefits – including sleeping better.

What’s also great about yoga is that it requires very little equipment or money. A mat is a nice extra, but all you need are some comfortable clothes and a bit of space. You can choose a yoga studio or take classes at your gym, but another alternative is practicing at home with either a book or video instruction. Tara Stiles’ four DVD <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tara-Stiles-This-Yoga-Encyclopedia/dp/B0096WOKWM"">set</a> <em>This is Yoga</em> has earned acclaim from health and fitness magazine reviewers.

While challenging, yoga is not about competition. You can use rectangular blocks to help you with poses (or postures) if you aren’t as flexible as the girl on the Lululemon poster. No matter what shape you are in you can practice yoga effectively. After awhile it starts to feel really good and everyday motions feel better, so it’s a sustainable exercise form.

I’m certainly not discouraging vigorous exercise if you enjoy it, but yoga can help improve your everyday health and serve as an outlet for tension and stress. It’s physical activity that makes your body feel better as you get older.","As we age the effects of compounded stress can be extremely taxing on our overall health.

1022,"Grandparenting in the Melting Pot","Most people feel that having a mixed-race grandchild is no big deal and a great gift.  There’s so much to enjoy by having a family that is influenced by more than one cultural or ethnic tradition.  Families are learning to share in traditions and teachings, and more and more children are becoming bilingual from the get go.

According to a <a href=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/16/the-rise-of-intermarriage/"">2012 report by the Pew Research Center</a>, about 15 percent of all new marriages in the United States in 2010 were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from one another which means that over the next decade as many as one in seven children could be of mixed race. The U.S. Census predicts that by 2050, African Americans, Latinos and Asians will collectively become the majority in this country.

<strong>For grandparents of today’s world, there is an opportunity to learn about another culture in a meaningful way.</strong> Taking an extended trip to the homeland of your son or daughter in-law is an opportunity for the grandkids to understand their roots and for grandparents to enjoy a cultural journey.

The world is becoming smaller with major shifts in the international economic power ladder.  The fact that more of us are connected by blood may serve as a powerful tool in achieving better understanding between countries and culture.

Retired professional football player Hines Ward made waves when he visited South Korea, the birthplace of his mother. It raised awareness of the racism his mother faced being with Ward’s black father in her home country. Wards success in a very popular American pastime helps normalize that being American can very easily mean being a person with multiple racial identities.

<strong>Some grandparents from past generations still hold resentment that their children married outside of their race.</strong> While it’s difficult to confront prejudices, life is short and the grandchildren are the ones who suffer from not having a relationship with their grandparents. It’s vital to confront any lingering racial tension your parents may have with the rest of the family – after all - the bloodlines have already crossed.","Most people feel that having a mixed-race grandchild is no big deal and a great gift.  There’s so much to enjoy by having a family that is influenced by more than one cultural or ethnic tradition.","2020-01-08 14:36:58",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/grandparenting-melting-pot/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mixed-race-family.jpg,"mixed race family",,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mixed-race-family.jpg,,Caregiving|Longevity,,,4,86,,,,,79,3316,,"mixed-race grandchildren","Mixed-race grandchildren - the melting pot is growing","Most people feel that having mixed-race grandchildren is no big deal and a great gift.

1039,"Under-the-radar cities for retirement","Photo of Austin, TX from GlobeImages.com

For those who want to live out their 30 Bonus Years with plenty of activities for the mind and body, I've discovered some cities that may not immediately come to mind for retirement.

<strong>Austin, Texas:</strong> This vibrant cultural center is a focal point for arts and technology. As a university town, Austin has an exciting dining scene, University of Texas football games, lots of classes that can be audited and a low-cost of living.

<strong>Billings, Montana:</strong> There’s a small town feel with the allure of a beautiful mountain town. Outdoorsy types will thrive here with a low-cost of living and access to a variety of natural wonders. It’s the Old West for sure, but with modern amenities.

<strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania:</strong> The post-industrial slump is over and the Three Rivers city has quietly emerged as once of the best urban centers to settle in. A healthy arts and entertainment scene, coupled with an unpretentious attitude, make Pittsburgh a city worth considering.  Oh…and did I mention – it’s also home to the Steelers - my favorite football team!

<strong>Burlington, Vermont:</strong> Nature lovers will find this progressive town a haven. Known for Ben &amp; Jerry’s Ice Cream and the jam band Phish, the laid-back attitude rules here. Upscale dining, local markets and thriving live music, beer and coffee scene are ideal for someone with activism and intellectualism in their blood.","For those who want to live out their 30 Bonus Years with plenty of activities for the mind and body, I've discovered some cities that may not immediately come to mind for retirement.","2020-09-25 14:55:14",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/cities-for-retirement/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/austin_texas.jpg,"austin texas",,"Lady Bird Lake and downtown Austin, Texas",,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/austin_texas.jpg,,Caregiving|Longevity,,,4,86,,,,,69,2236,,"cities for retirement","Under-the-rader cities for retirement","When thinking of cities for retirement, there are the usual suspects.

The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323335404578444930439201270.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">reported</a> that adventure travel for the 50-plus crowd is more popular than ever. That’s great news as far as I’m concerned.  Recently I’ve been trying to get boomers and seniors to take trips that will push their limits as a part of my <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/30-bonus-years/"">30 Bonus Years</a> philosophy.

The <em>Journal</em> cites a woman, 65, who has proudly built an igloo in Romania, climbed the Himalayas and canoed in Nepal (with crocodiles in the water). If canoeing with the crocs is not your thing, that’s quite OK. What I’m asking you to consider is taking a trip that’s outside of your comfort zone.

I'm not advocating for any of you to risk your safety — there are many tours that are led by experienced guides who are aware of the physical limitations of older bodies. After all, osteoarthritis is pretty common, not to mention tender lower backs and all the other day-to-day aches that we face.

Volunteer trips, such as teaching English in rural China, can be easily arranged as quite often the need is greater than the supply. Learning a new skill such as SCUBA diving while visiting the Great Barrier Reef is another way to fulfill your experiential journey desires.

1055,"Caregiver Interview with Dr. Alexis","<strong>What tips would you give to someone who is brand new to caregiving for their parent?</strong>

Being the primary caregiver for an older loved one is tough, and expectations are frequently quite high. The most important tip I can offer new caregivers is to always take care of yourself - to care for the caregiver! With that said, there are ways to relieve some of the stress, and much of it revolves around a shift in your mindset. After all, each of us can only do so much before we simply break down! One of the keys to success for maintaining a positive caregiver lifestyle is to take time away from your responsibilities and make time for yourself. Truly try to be “in the moment” and simply enjoy a hobby or other activity that allows you to lose yourself and just let go.

Even if you have the best caregiver support system, on many occasions the needs of your loved ones will become incredibly demanding (at least that’s how it feels). By taking some to time recharge and de-stress, you’ll become a more pleasant and productive caregiver. Making sure you’re getting enough sleep, eating healthy and exercising are all essential elements of caring for the caregiver.

<strong>Here are a few more tips to keep in mind as you go through your caregiving journey:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Develop a routine.</strong> Each morning have a glass of water, some protein and engage in light movement/exercise. This sets the right tone for each day and jump-starts your body.</li>
	<li><strong>Find a hobby and really dig into it.</strong> Whether you’re reading a book, at a Star Trek convention or tuning into “Mad Men,” completely immerse yourself into something that brings you simple joy.</li>
	<li><strong>Slow down.</strong> A recent New York Times article indicated that slowing down, contrary to what one might assume, helps you become more efficient. Clearly the quality of what you do is as important as the quantity of the things you accomplish.</li>
	<li><strong>Eat right.</strong> It’s amazing how junk food zaps your energy and healthy food fuels the body. Don’t be too strict – otherwise eating properly just becomes another form of stress – just try to keep your meals simple, nutritious and fresh.</li>
	<li><strong>Ask for help.</strong> You can’t expect your friends and family to automatically offer to help. Speak up and communicate your needs. I recently recorded a video that will help you learn how to ask your family members for help.</li>
	<li><strong>Think quality.</strong> Make the most of your time when you’re caregiving. Try your best to be attentive and truly listen to your aging loved ones. Open lines of communication go a long way towards earning mutual respect.</li>
	<li><strong>Utilize resources.</strong> There are so many untapped products and services available to help ease caregiver stress – use them. They range from great caregiving blog websites such as www.caresquad.com to products like the <a href=""http://www.vtechphones.com/careline"">VTech Careline</a><b>™</b> phone, which will help enhance communication with your aging loved ones and provide a little peace of mind when you are not with them.</li>
</ul>
Be sure to recognize that you still may feel overwhelmed, even when you do implement these tips and other lifestyle changes. Gaining back control of your life often relates to having meaning in your days. Of course, this is easier said than done. So don’t worry if you seem to be making positive changes more slowly than you’d like; they will all add up. The most important thing is to not feel guilty. You can’t be everything to everyone. You must make yourself a priority!

<strong>What first steps should they take to learn about caregiving?</strong>

Having been a caregiver myself for over 10 years and written the book “The Caregivers Survival Handbook” – I can promise you that being organized and well prepared is definitely one of the most important aspects of a successful caregiving journey! It’s quite likely that at one point or another we will all be faced with what is often referred to as the “impossible profession” - caregiving. Currently there are over 44 million caregivers in the United States -- nearly one in four U.S. households is involved in caring for a relative or friend aged 50 or older. The average age of a caregiver is 57. Caregiving is largely a women's issue. Some 72 percent of caregivers are female, mostly wives and adult daughters. More than one in three, however, are mature adults themselves (65 years of age and older). Caregiving can last from less than a year to over forty years. 80 percent of caregivers provide at least some type of unpaid assistance seven days a week. By 2030 one in five Americans will be at least 65, for a total of about 70 million older people, more than twice the number than in 1996. Over 100 million people in the U.S. have one or more chronic condition and over the next twenty-five years this number is expected to increase to 134 million Americans.

<strong>What are some caregiver resources new caregivers can find on the web?</strong>

Here are some important online caregiver resources for you to consult when you are just entering the role of ""caregiver' and in need of caregiving support, respite or simply someone to talk to!

Caring for an aging loved one is one of the hardest jobs you will ever have. There will most likely be times when you’ll feel that you just can’t go on – times when it seems you and your family can’t agree on anything; times when no one, including your parent, appreciates what you’re doing, yet everyone makes you feel invisible; times when you feel you just can’t pick up another prescription, schedule another appointment, lose another night’s sleep or see your parent slip further away from the strong, competent adult who once cared for and protected you. Yes, there will be times when every day, indeed every hour, feels like a struggle for survival.

It’s times like those that you must reach out for help. You must. Though it may seem hard to believe at this point in your life, your caregiving duties won’t go on forever. When your days as a caregiver have ended, you’ll want to look back and know you did the best you could for your parent with all of the resources available to you. You’ll want to know you made the most of the last days, months and years with your loved one – surviving the bad times but always remembering to seek out and cherish the good. Just as important, you will want to have a life to return to – filled with people you love, activities that interest you, and the good health to enjoy them. Your aging loved one would want nothing less for you!

<strong>What are your tips about dealing with your parent's possessions -- both if they stay in their home or if they are downsizing or moving in with you?</strong>

Having just moved to a different home -- I completely understand how it feels to change locations or downsize. Letting go of your possessions is something that is very hard for all us and it can be even more difficult for someone who has lived in a particular neighborhood or house for a lifetime! I recently wrote a blog on this exact topic - it especially focuses on how to help your parent's begin to let go of some of the ""emotional ties"" they have with items they've been hanging onto for years...even decades! But fear not, there are specially-trained ""senior relocation specialists"" who focus on helping older adults move with ease. They start with a pre-move consultation to help come up with a plan as to the best items to keep and those your aging loved one might consider leaving behind. The specialist makes it a very positive experience for the individual involved and makes sure they bring all of their sentimental belongings to their new home. The specialist then sets the older adult up in the new home and creates a look and feel as similar as possible to their previous home. This helps make the individual ""feel at home."" If you go online and google ""senior relocation specialists"" you will find a helpful resource in your aging loved ones area.

If you choose to go it alone (without a senior relocation specialist) here are some tips to help ease the process of downsizing your parents current home or helping them downsize so they can move to another location (or into your home!).

1.<strong> Stay positive.</strong> Keep reminding them about all of the space they will have once they've ""unloaded"" some of the items they don't use. Reinforce how organized things will feel. Remind them that this time of life doesn’t have to be a period of “diminishing returns” - it can also be thought of as an opportunity to make a fresh start!
2. <strong>Let the emotions flow. </strong>When it comes time to downsize a home the sheer amount of physical labor is usually enormous and it can be very emotional! So bring on the emotions! This is the opportunity for them to say goodbye to their possessions in a way that has meaning and purpose. Let your parents reminisce and celebrate all the memories. Take it all in and (most importantly) smile.
3. <strong>Take baby steps.</strong> By creating some structure and deadlines, you will most likely gain more assurance that the project will actually get done and hopefully reduce some of the stress! Bring a bottle of wine or make spaghetti in the kitchen to eat with your parents (distract them!).

<strong>Take incremental steps toward creating your goal:</strong>

<strong>First</strong>, go through the house with your parents and any available, interested siblings and make a list of everything that someone might want to take home with them (at a future time). Have a camera handy and take a photo of each item.
<strong>Second</strong>, based on a group discussion, create a system that feels fair to everyone, such as selecting items in rounds, letting each person pick one item from the inventory during each round.
<strong>Third</strong>, have each sibling pick a deadline by which they will get all their chosen belongings from the house.
Finally, go through the remainder of the items in the house and label them for donation, resale, or permanent disposal and then arrange for removal.",,"2020-06-18 23:56:36",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/caregiver-interview-dr-alexis/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/iStock_000013014826Medium.jpg,iStock_000013014826Medium,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/iStock_000013014826Medium.jpg,,Caregiving,,,4,86,,,,,,2831,,,,,,,973,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",-,2015-06-18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",caregiver-interview-dr-alexis,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 18:03:42",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1062,"White Paper: Meal Services for Seniors","This white paper was written as part of a comprehensive consulting arrangement for <a href=""http://www.morrisonseniorliving.com/Pages/Home.aspx"">Morrison Senior Living</a>.  I have posted it here with permission from the client.


<h4>CHANGING THE FACE OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED MEAL SERVICES</h4>
When Congress authorized the home and community based elderly nutrition program in 1972, Richard Nixon was president, a gallon of gas cost 55 cents, leisure suits were the latest fashion, hybrids were something your grandmother grew in her garden and terms like cell phone and the Internet were not part of our daily vernacular.

The world has certainly changed, but the goal of the nutrition program – to address problems of food insecurity (insufficient food or access to food), provide socialization, and promote the health and well-being of older persons through nutrition and nutrition-related services – <i>has not</i>.

Elderly nutrition programs provided more than 241 million meals for older people in 2009 – 149.1 million delivered directly to seniors’ homes and 92.5 million served in a variety of community (so called congregate dining) settings.  Due to the current graying of America the demand for well-organized home and community based meal services (HCBS) is growing at an unprecedented rate.

In 2008, 14.6 percent of United States households fell into the food-insecure category at some point during the year—the highest rate since the Department of Agriculture started recording related statistics in 1995. For the senior population, hunger is a monumental problem that needs immediate attention.  The Meals On Wheels Association of America (MOWAA), the oldest and largest organization offering meal services to people in need, recently reported that as of 2007, there were nearly 6 million seniors in the U.S. facing the threat of hunger<b><i>. </i></b>But achieving the program’s goal of nourishing these food-insecure seniors is exceedingly challenging. When adjusted for inflation, the total amount of funding appropriated for nutrition services under the Older American Act has decreased substantially over the past two decades ($819.5 million for FY2010 compared to $941.7 million in FY1990). Add to that decreased private donations to supplement the programs, prohibitions against means testing and payment for nutrition services under Title III of the Older Americans Act (into which the program was incorporated in 1978), and the rapidly growing senior population, and it’s easy to see how programs dedicated to feeding seniors are potentially in danger.

Interestingly, one of the greatest strains on the program may also turn out to be one of its biggest assets—the aging baby boomers, the first of whom turned 65 on January 1, 2011.  Some 10,000 more will turn 65 each day through 2029. By the time the last baby boomer turns 65, the population aged 65 and older will have doubled.

Born between 1946 and 1964, the baby boomers are the largest, most vocal and most demanding generation in American history. They are also the wealthiest generation, controlling more than two-thirds of the nation’s assets. Projections from the Met Life Market Institute show that by the time the last boomer turns 65, the generation will control more than 40 percent of disposable income in the United States.<b><i> </i></b>Retirees could eventually control as much as $136 trillion.

While clearly there will always be people who need subsidized nutrition services because they would otherwise go hungry, there will also be a significant number of seniors who can afford to pay for their food and additional conveniences.  Still others from this new <i>“wealthy”</i> segment of seniors will be able, and willing, to pay to get what they want, when they want it, the way they want it.

To meet the future needs of the various types of consumers, providers of home and community-based meal services should run two parallel, yet synergistic, business models:  a non-profit program for low-income or means-tested customers, which would continue to be funded by state and federal dollars and private donations, and a for-profit operation that would be paid for by the consumers themselves.  The latter could perhaps supplement funding for the non-profit program for those seniors who are unable to pay or are paying on a sliding scale according to their income level.

While many aspects of this report will touch on all three groups of clients – those who cannot pay, those who can afford to pay for some extra conveniences, and those able and willing to pay a premium for special foods and services – the unpredictability of federal funding prompts us to focus largely on the third, more affluent group, who hold the power to help financially support these services for seniors across the board.

To serve the more affluent boomers, home and community based service providers will have to make significant changes to a program that has changed little since 1972. Just like the leisure suit has gone out of style, so has the traditional senior center, serving up a rubber chicken and congealed salad lunch followed by Bingo or a bridge game. To attract tomorrow’s seniors, the traditional senior center will have to appeal to a more active, demanding clientele, by offering a variety of food choices as well as activities ranging from videography to dating services, all in a more attractive upscale environment.

Similarly meal delivery services will need to make changes to serve the varied nutritional needs and tastes of the aging baby boomers. This may include pre-cut foods for seniors with limited manual dexterity, foods for special diets (low-sodium, low-cholesterol, low-carbohydrate), spicier foods to tempt aging taste buds and ethnic dishes for consumers of different cultural groups.  <b><i></i></b>

For baby boomers who can afford higher-end menu offerings, the ability to get quality, healthful foods conveniently will mean more than just cost. Witness the success of Whole Foods Market, an Austin, Texas-based grocer specializing in natural and organic foods.   When the recession squelched spending on indulges such as its expensive chocolates and cheeses, Whole Foods Market shifted its focus back to its natural and organic roots, with highly profitable results. In the most recent quarter, the company reported earnings of $57 million, or 33 cents a share, up from $36 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier.

The chain is now making changes for convenience, adding healthier prepared foods and baked goods in stores nationwide that meet new criteria such as sprouted grain bread with no refined flour, added oil, refined sugar or processed ingredients. <b><i></i></b>

With some strategic planning, HCBS providers should have a similarly profitable program. Targeted at upscale consumers, the program could also potentially supplement funding to meet the goals established for elderly nutrition programs in 1972<b><i>. </i></b>

While there are a myriad of trends associated with the baby boomer generation, this report examines the critical directives needed to properly transform home and community based meal programs to efficiently serve all mature adults who are seeking socialization, independence and proper nutrition.  The dozen transformational concepts that follow represent a paradigm shift and the adoption of alternative thinking in an attempt to create a less stagnate nutrition program for our nation’s older adults, regardless of income level, ethnicity, health concerns or special dietary needs.

<b>1.  Follow Population Trends.</b>  The 65-plus population is expected to grow by 36 percent overall between 2010 and 2020, with some areas experiencing higher percentages of growth than others. Thus, the prospect of serving the greatest number of seniors, and consequently creating increased revenue opportunities, will require directing services to areas expected to experience the highest amount of growth.

With the recession and housing crisis slowing migration between states and cities, more boomers are aging in place than in past decades. This means that areas that have experienced the highest increase in the baby boomer population in recent years will likely be the same ones experiencing the greatest growth in the senior population tomorrow.

For example, the Urban Institute -- a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that conducts research, and educates Americans on social and economic issues– predicts that Georgia’s senior population will increase by 40 percent between 2010 and 2020 due to the aging of baby boomers. On the other hand, Florida -- which has long been a haven for seniors from the cold northern states -- will likely experience slowed growth as fewer people flee large cities such as New York and Chicago.  Thus the greatest demand for services for seniors tomorrow may not be the same as in past years or today.

According to an analysis by the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, D.C., the following metropolitan areas experienced the greatest gains in the 55 to 64 population between 2000 and 2007 and will likely experience the highest rate of growth in seniors in the decade ahead due to the aging of the baby boomers. As a result, these 20 areas represent prime markets for ramping up senior home delivery and congregate nutrition services.
<ul>
	<li>Raleigh-Carey, N.C. (31.6 percent increase between 2000 and 2007).</li>
	<li>Austin-Round Rock, Texas (30.1 percent increase between 2000 and 2007)</li>
	<li>Atlanta- Sandy Springs- Marietta, Ga. (29.8 percent increase between 2000 and 2007)</li>
	<li>Boise City-Nampa, Idaho (28.7 percent increase between 2000 and 2007)</li>
	<li>Las Vegas-Paradise, Nev. (27.8 percent increase between 2000 and 2007)</li>
</ul>
Others rounding out the top 20 are: Orlando-Kissimmee, Fla.; Houston-Sugar Land- Baytown, Texas; Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colo.; McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas; Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.; Charleston-North Charleston, S.C.;  Albuquerque, N.M.; Tucson, Ariz.; Washington, D.C. -Arlington-Alexandria, Va.;  Salt Lake City, Utah; Charlotte-Gastonia-Concord, N.C.-S.C. ; Denver-Aurora, Colo.; Nashville-Davidson-Murphreesboro-Franklin, Tenn.; Ogden-Clearfield-Utah.

<b>2.  Update the Image.</b> Much like the homes of deserving families selected for renovation on the popular TV series, home and community services are in need of an <i>extreme</i> makeover. Home delivery and congregate dining services tend to have a stigma attached to them due to the long-standing circulation of misinformation widely disseminated both externally and within the HCBS industry.  A recent survey conducted by Bateman Senior Meals, a division of the Compass Group, indicated that ___ percent of their meal recipients stated that they feel home delivery and congregate feeding is perceived as being strictly for ”low income” participants.

The Meals On Wheels Association of America, formed in 1976, has reportedly struggled in recent years with the perception of being <i>strictly</i> a poverty or government-funded program, neither of which is true. Some clients have supposedly asked drivers to remove Meals On Wheels signage from their vehicles before entering their neighborhoods in an effort to reduce the “embarrassment factor” associated with receiving a free meal; others have refused the service entirely, believing that by accepting the meal they are depriving someone else who needs it more than they do.

According to Peggy Ingraham, MOWAA Senior Vice President for Public Policy, Meals On Wheels provides nutrition to seniors regardless of their income, and is not strictly a government program.  In fact, of the 5,000 senior nutrition programs across the country, only 3,000 receive any type of state or federal funding, yet, Ingraham reports, its perception as a government program at times interferes with Meals On Wheels’ ability to get private funding,

Updating the current image of home and community based services, such as Meals On Wheels, might involve a name and logo change, a move several nonprofits have taken in recent years. Most recently the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) became simply “The Y” to align with how most people commonly refer to the organization. The organization also unveiled a new logo — the first logo change since 1967 – “to better reflect the vibrancy of the Y and the diversity of the communities it serves,“ according to the organization.  A decade ago, the American Association of Retired People dropped its formal name to become AARP, doing away with the word “retired,” which research indicated was increasingly irrelevant to its current and potential membership.

A new name and updated image will bring new life and a brand extension to meal delivery services and attract a whole new clientele, including customers who are able and willing to pay for meals and other services.

<b>3.   Serve More Than Meals</b>.  Bundling services, which has proven successful for Internet providers, can also provide new revenue opportunities for home-based meal delivery companies and offer a much-needed service for the seniors they serve. While homebound seniors need nutritious food, they also need paper goods, medications, toiletries, etc.. As recent business models have shown, people like to have – and are willing to pay a premium for – books, videos and other items to be delivered directly to their homes.  One example is the Atlanta-based Zifty.com, which advertises it will deliver “everything from DVD rentals, games, food, and more to you in about an hour or less.” Among seniors surveyed by Bateman Senior Meals___ percent indicated that they would want the option to pay for additional services similar those offered by Zifty.com.

Anticipating the additional needs homebound seniors might require, meal delivery organizations should make available supplementary services that are not currently being provided. For those needing assistance with minor household chores, the bundle could include 10 or 15 minutes of the driver’s time for simple tasks such as replacing a burnt-out light bulb, moving a piece of furniture, loosening child-proof tops on medicine bottles, washing a sink full of dishes, starting a load of laundry, moving items from a high shelf to a lower one, or sweeping the front porch steps.  The driver could also deliver certain items that are requested such as prescription medication, grocery items, stamps, etc.

While bundling services may not be plausible for the low-income model, it could offer a potential source of revenue for the provider and a needed service for means-tested and private-pay clients.

Serving “more than meals” is also a good strategy for congregate dining centers, which have seen declining numbers of clients over the past two decades. Between 1990 and 2008, the number of congregate meals served through the elderly nutrition program dropped by 34 percent, while the number of home-delivered meals grew by 44 percent. Experts attribute the decrease in congregate dining to a number of possible factors, including the trend by states to transfer funds from their congregate service allotments to home-delivered services, and greater growth in home-delivered services relative to the congregate program funds.  Magi Brettler, Regional Vice President at Bateman Senior Meals, suggests the negative perception of congregate dining centers also may play a role in the decline. “People avoid them because they don't want to be seen in a poverty program if they have money,” she says.

Regardless of the reason for the shift, congregate dining offers benefits – primarily companionship and connectedness – for mobile seniors that meal delivery services cannot, and efforts to boost that component of food services is crucial.

For seniors who have their meals in congregate dining locations, adding more creative options would add more value. It might also draw in more clients.  Helpful services might include a small library where individuals could swap books, medication delivery to the site so seniors could pick up their prescriptions, the services of a registered dietitian to offer dietary planning, and on-site tax preparation services each year at tax time.

But to draw in significantly more clients or bring them in more frequently, organizations must consider the wants and interests of mature adults, who, as a whole, are living longer and in better health than at any time in history and want to feel engaged and connected. Such services might include memoir writing and videography classes, free wi-fi or Internet cafes, gyms or weight rooms with the optional services of a physical therapist or a physical trainer, or even an on-site dating or matchmaking service for widows and widowers.

Taking a more active role in the enhancement of the center would be a wise investment by a food services provider, when food alone isn’t attracting the optimal number of clients.  Enhancing the center could mean more than adding additional services. It might also mean changing the location and upgrading the environment where meals are offered and the times they are available.  For example, physically moving dining centers from places like church basements or government buildings to malls or shopping centers alongside Starbuck’s or Einstein Bagels would enhance the availability and aesthetics of the dining experience. Having them operate the same hours as nearby shops would allow seniors to stop in for a hot lunch or a nutritious snack or to visit with friends after shopping or mall walking.

Enhancing centers could also include updating the image with more attractive décor, inviting exteriors and even a more appealing name to attract a new generation of seniors who may be put off by names like community center, senior center or congregate dining center.

In Chicago, examples of new senior centers can be seen at cafes operated by Mather Lifeways, a non-for-profit service agency. The cafes, located in working-class neighborhoods, attract younger (55 and up) and older seniors alike, who come to enjoy a cup of coffee or lunch. With their open kitchens, bright colors, floating ceiling panels and modern light fixtures, the cafes scarcely resemble your grandmother’s senior center.

<b>4.  Provide Companionship. </b>While some seniors would prefer to have add-on services bundled with their meal delivery, for others the most valuable supplementary service would be a longer visit with their delivery person.  Interestingly, the recent Bateman Senior Meals survey indicated that ___ percent of respondents ranked spending time with the person delivering the food as being <i>more </i>important than the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">price <i>or</i> timing of their meal delivery</span>. <b>
</b>

Twenty-eight percent of Americans over the age of 65 live alone. For those over age 85, that increases to 48 percent. Increasing time between scheduled deliveries would allow drivers to spend more time with seniors who live alone and often long for companionship.

Older adults who are homebound due to health problems or mobility limitations are often isolated and at risk for loneliness and depression.  In a given year, between 1 and 2 percent of people over age 65 suffer from major depression, meaning that intense sadness or the absence of pleasure or the ability to experience it disrupts social functioning and activities of daily living. About 2 percent have dysthymia – a less severe but long-lasting lack of enjoyment or pleasure in life that in some cases also affects daily functioning and sleep – and, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, up to a fourth or more have subclinical depression that does not meet the criteria for depression but nonetheless is associated with increased risk of depression, physical disability, medical illness and high use of health services. Research has also found a significant association between social isolation and negative health outcomes. Individuals who lack social connections or report frequent feelings of loneliness are more likely to suffer higher rates of illness, death, infection and cognitive decline.

According to “Social Isolation: Strategies for Connecting and Engaging Older People,” a report by the Cornell Institute for Translational Research on Aging, people living below the poverty line are at particular risk of social isolation. Of all seniors living alone and below the poverty line, one-third go as long as two weeks at a time without seeing friends or neighbors; one-fifth have no phone conversations with friends or family.

Thus, for many housebound seniors, the contact with a person delivering their meals may be the only human contact they have some days or even weeks. Even a 15-minute visit would provide a welcome reprieve from the loneliness and isolation these mature adults experience. Whether it’s spent sitting down to look through old photo albums, listening to stories about their grandchildren or just talking about the weather, a delivery person’s time and attention is the most welcome service many seniors could receive.

For older adults who are able to get out, community dining offers similar benefits of companionship. Enjoying a meal and conversation with others reduces isolation that has become increasingly common as families have become smaller and often spread out geographically.  Seniors are also likely to eat more in the company of others, therefore nutrition may be improved.

Such add-on services will also offer much needed respite for primary caregivers who have seniors they are caring that live close by. Relieving the caregiver from being the sole source of help and companionship for their aging loved one will reduce the stress very often associated with the role of caregiving, which has been shown to take a toll on the caregiver’s emotional and physical health. An estimated 20 percent of family caregivers suffer from depression – about twice that of the general population. For long distance caregivers, knowing that someone regularly sees and spends time with their aging loved one can provide a high level of comfort and help alleviate concerns about their loved ones safety and security.

<b>5.  Co-Brand with a Membership Only Club.</b> In an effort to significantly increase revenue and the current client base at congregate dining centers - and help ensure mature adults frequent return – it would be wise to operate dining centers in areas where senior-oriented health clubs are already positioned.

Research shows that baby boomers make up the fastest growing segment of health club membership.  People over 55 now represent nearly a quarter of all health club members, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association.  Joining forces with “senior clubs” would give seniors a place to dine and work out side-by-side with other seniors – not hard-bodied twenty-somethings – in classes designed to improve balance, strengthen fragile bones, increase joint range of motion and maintain functional ability, all of which are of special concern to seniors.

Much like the Y, senior centers could offer different levels of membership. For a basic fee, the member would have access to the gym and café during all open hours and could participate in classes or other activities for an additional cost. For a higher fee, members would not only have full access to the gym, but could take classes at a discount or no additional charge. Premium members might also receive other perks (free or discounted tickets for the theater, sporting events, municipal golf courses or hair salons; upgraded meals, branded workout gear; access to a personal trainer, for example) that are not offered members paying the basic member fee. Also, as is the case in many private health clubs, reciprocal memberships could be extended to clubs in other cities and states so that seniors could workout, attend a class or have a meal while traveling or staying with family in another town.

Managed much like the “senior club” concept, the North Shore Senior Center serves 32 Chicago suburbs, from Evanston to Highland Park, operating from a vast 40,000-square-foot building. Members pay a $60 annual membership fee and the center includes a fitness center, sculpture studio, café, classrooms and a sunny atrium.  With 4,000 members and 700 volunteers, North Shore gets $1 million a year from donors and raised $15 million more in a capital campaign for the new building.

One way North Shore cultivates relationships with the “young-old” is by helping them care for elderly parents, with a daughters support group and geriatric case managers. Another attraction is the fitness center — members pay $350 extra — where fliers advertise boomer-friendly “brain fitness” classes for the worried well and a conference on female spirituality.

By operating within an established club, congregate dining centers would give seniors a sense of belonging and – with membership perks – more value for their dollar. Paying dues would also increase the likelihood that mature adults would return often, wanting to make the most of their investment.

<b>6. Cater to Aging Taste Buds.</b>  We are born with 9,000 or 10,000 taste buds on our tongues as well as on the sides and roof of the mouth, but around age 40 to 50 in women and 50 to 60 in men the number of taste buds begins to decrease and the remaining taste buds start to atrophy and become less sensitive.<b><i> </i></b>Similar age-related changes in the sense of smell – which plays a major role in what we perceive as taste – as well as illnesses, smoking or a lifelong accumulation of environmental exposures can amplify the problem.

Aging’s effects on the ability to taste – along with the growing popularity of ethnic foods and the desire for low-fat, low-salt seasonings – is prompting tomorrow's seniors to seek out bolder, spicier foods.

The demand for spicy foods is evidenced by the plethora of ethnic restaurants and high-octane offerings at chain restaurants including McDonald's <i>Chipotle BBQ Snack Wrap</i> and T.G.I. Friday's <i>Wicked Wings</i>, as well as a growing list of spicy snack foods on supermarket shelves, including <i>Spicy Guacamole Pringles</i> and <i>Flamin' Hot Cheetos</i>.

Older adults also prefer boldly flavored cheeses, such as bleu, feta and Gorgonzola, according to Sloan Trends, Inc., an Escondido, Calif., firm that tracks behavioral and consumer habits in food and nutrition.

Food manufacturers have found that making food more palatable to aging boomers goes beyond enhancing the taste, but also the texture and color of the food. For example, research has shown that the color red enhances food's acceptability among the baby boomer age group. Food with more texture can also heighten taste.

____percent of those who responded to the Bateman Senior Services survey reported that they felt that by adding sauces or spices it would greatly improve the flavor of the prepared food that they were being served.

To improve food flavor – and consumption – and increase brand recognition, food service providers should try what barbecue restaurants and Mexican restaurants have done for years:  offer branded sauces and seasonings of different heat levels (think mild to el scorcho) that can be added at the table.

Offering seasonings as an option – either on the table or in packets delivered with meals – allows customers to season foods to their personal taste and helps prevent over-seasoning for seniors with health conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease that are often exacerbated by spicy or highly seasoned foods.

<b>7. Offer Variety and Convenience.</b>   Raised in an era where regularly eating out became commonplace, ice cream shops offered 31 flavors, and fast food restaurants promised that you can “have it your way,” baby boomers are used to choosing from a variety of foods prepared to their own specification – and quickly.

A 2009 survey by Cornell University Center for Hospitality Research found that adults age 55 and older eat out an average of 51 times a year, and roughly half of the 20 most popular restaurants among the 55-plus age group are fast food chains, including Wendy’s KFC, Burger King, Taco Bell, Dairy Queen, Panda Express and McDonald’s.

To lure customers from fast food and casual dining establishments, congregate dining centers must offer more food options and make it easier for customers to get them.

___ percent of Bateman survey respondents said that they would be willing to pay extra for more increased food variety, and ___ percent said they would be willing to pay more for a specific type of beverage if it were served with their meal.

For delivery programs, seniors could be a given a menu of items from which to choose for the week.  In fact __ percent of survey respondents said they would be willing to pay an additional fee for this add-on.  At congregate dining centers variety and choice should be emphasized in a cafeteria, deli or even a food-court setting, with different stations offering different food choices (salad, sandwiches, Asian food, Mexican foods, frozen yogurt and desserts). Rather than everyone sitting down to an identical meal, seniors could mix and match their own favorite a` la carte dishes to create a nutritionally balanced meal, whether it be meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans or seafood burritos with a Caesar salad.

Steps to increase convenience could include techniques used by chain restaurants including drive-thru service; phone-ahead and online ordering with curbside service or designated parking places for customers picking up phone or Internet orders; and even money-saving coupons distributed by direct mail, newspapers with high senior readership, organizations such as AARP or websites that cater to baby boomers and seniors.   Adopting these techniques, which have led to success for so many of their favorite restaurants, would enable to seniors to get the foods they want when they want them and perhaps the satisfaction of saving a little time in the process.

<b>8.  Acknowledge Ethnic Diversity.</b>  The seniors of today – and even more so tomorrow – are an ethnically diverse group.  While the media tends to routinely portray baby boomers as white, in fact 12 percent are African-American, 9 percent are Hispanic, 4 percent are Asian or Pacific Islander, and a bit less than 1 percent are Native American or Native Alaskan.

By the middle of this century, the percentage of African-American seniors is projected increase from 8 to 10 percent of Americans over age 65.  The Hispanic population, which currently represents fewer than 4 percent of older people in the U.S., is projected to represent nearly 16 percent of older adults by mid-century.

To succeed at serving this diverse senior population today and particularly in the coming decades, nutrition programs must embrace their clients’ diversity. Serving familiar ethnic foods at congregate meal sites and through home delivery services will increase the likelihood that clients will eat – and enjoy – their meals. Serving ethnic foods may also be a way to increase participation – and revenue – at congregate dining centers by baby boomers as a whole, whose tastes have been shaped by diversity. ___ percent of Bateman Senior Services survey respondents said they would be willing to pay extra for ethnic dishes.<b><i></i></b>

When designing menus, meal service providers need to consider the cultural food preferences for all participants, looking at the population make-up of the area they are serving – for example, cites like Honolulu; Bellview, Washington; Sugar Land, Texas; and Holmdel Township, N.J, where the Chinese-American population is higher than 10 percent; or cities like Chamblee, Georgia; Hialeah, Florida; Minidoka, Idaho; Reading, Pennsylvania; Douglas, Arizona; and Pasco, Washington, where more than half – and, in some cases, close to 90 percent – of the population is Hispanic.

While dishes like spaghetti with garlic bread, and beef and broccoli are staples of many nutrition programs, providers should consider adding less common choices gained from other cultures, particularly for customers willing to pay a premium for ethnic dishes.

In particular, serving the nation’s burgeoning Hispanic population – which the Census Bureau projects will constitute nearly 30 percent of the U.S. population, or 132.8 million people, by the year 2050 -- presents a particular challenge, but also a potentially profitable opportunity for food service providers.

Depending on their country of origin, Hispanic Americans face a greater risk of certain health conditions, including obesity and diet-mediated problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.  For example, almost half of Hispanics over age 65 have high blood pressure, according to the National Institutes of Health, and close to half of Hispanic-American adults as a whole have high or borderline high total cholesterol levels.

About 10.2 percent of all Hispanic Americans have diabetes – almost double the rate for non-Hispanic whites of similar age. Furthermore, Hispanic Americans who have diabetes are more likely to suffer end-stage kidney disease as a result, and are 50 percent more likely than non-Hispanic whites to die from diabetes-related complications.

Clearly, providing healthy and palatable food choices for this vulnerable and growing population should be one of the focuses of any nutrition program during the coming decades.  Although the food industry has made significant progress in developing healthy and functional foods for Hispanic consumers in recent years, according to Nerac, a Connecticut-based research firm dedicated to developing innovative products and technologies, the Hispanic market represents an undeveloped arena to promote lighter and healthier Latin American fare.

<b>9.  Accommodate Health Needs.</b> Thanks to improved nutrition and life-saving medical advances – antibiotics, vaccines,  heart surgery, blood thinners, improvements in cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the near eradication of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, just to name a few – seniors in America are living much longer than their parents and grandparents.

According to the Social Security Administration, the life expectancy of a 50-year-old man today is 79.4; for a 50-year-old woman life expectancy is 81.6, and life expectancy increases as one ages. A male who reaches age 65 can expect to live another 16 years, on average, to age 81. A woman who reaches 65 can expect to live another 19 years, to age 84. <b><i> </i></b>

But living longer often means living with chronic diseases, or diseases that often last the rest of one’s life and can affect quality of life – and nutritional needs.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eight out of 10 Americans age 65 and older are living with some form of chronic illness.

Common chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease and arthritis are likely to not only influence dietary needs (for example, low-sodium, low-fat, low-carbohydrate), but also the need for special packaging and food preparation.

For example, data from 2007 to 2009 show that 49.9 million American adults have self-reported, doctor-diagnosed arthritis. By 2020 an estimated 59.9 million – a large percentage of whom will be seniors – will have arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although it is not a disease <i>directly </i>affected by nutrition, arthritis can make it difficult for many people to get the proper nutrition they need. Arthritis in the hips and knees makes it difficult to stand and prepare foods. Arthritis in the jaw can make chewing difficult. Arthritis that affects the fingers and small joints of the hands, which is very common, can affect manual dexterity, making it difficult to open food packages and cut foods. Thus, easy-to-open packages, soft foods and food prepared in bite-size servings such as stews or casseroles, will well serve seniors, who may forgo a meal if they have difficulty opening the package or cutting the food into sizes they can eat. It is also a superb service for long-distance caregivers who are not available to help their aging loved one at meal time and will enable seniors with dexterity problems to stay independent longer.

A recent survey conducted by Bateman Senior Services resulted in end users reporting that ___ percent would be willing to pay extra for special meals, such as low-sodium (__percent), low-fat ( ___ percent), and low-carbohydrate (__ percent). ___ percent ranked easy-to-open-packages highest in importance, above _____ and ____ <b>(Again, this is a case where items are ranked, so we’ll have to see how this ranks with respondents.)</b>

<b>10.  Form Creative Collaborations.</b>  While the recession means fewer baby boomers are relocating upon retirement, it also means more grown children and grandchildren are moving in with their aging parents. According to AARP, more than six million children under 18 in America are living in a grandparent-headed household, which is a daunting challenge to the aging population. Among the issues these grandparents face are advanced aging and decreased energy, financial difficulties, caregiver burnout, the need for support wherever possible, and – according to a groundbreaking research study conducted by Meals On Wheels Association of America Foundation (MOWAAF) -- increased risk of hunger.

“The Causes, Consequences, and Future of Single Hunger in America” by MOWAAF found living with a grandchild to be an unexpected and significant predictor of hunger risk among seniors. Seniors with a grandchild in the home – regardless of whether the child’s parent(s) also lived there – were about 50 percent more likely to be at risk of hunger compared to those with no grandchild in the home.<b><i> </i></b>

The increase in intergenerational living – and risks associated with it – clearly presents special challenges for senior nutrition services. Yet, at the same time it may offer opportunities for partnerships with other organizations, programs and even private businesses that don’t immediately come to mind when thinking of feeding the elderly.

In 2006, an innovative partnership between MOWAA and Banfield, The Pet Hospital, resulted in the “Seasons of Supper Campaign” an annual fundraising event designed to ensure that seniors’ furry companions are healthy and well fed and that seniors’ nutrition isn’t compromised by sharing their food with their pets.  The Banfield Charitable Trust recognizes the importance of the bond between seniors and their pets throughout the year by funding pet food distributions across the country.

The success of the program, which involves 750 Banfield locations nationwide, only hints at how positive the reception would be for a partnership that funds meals for grandparents and their grandchildren.

<strong> Examples of potential partners to assist grandparent-headed families include:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) – a federal program serving low-income mothers and their children through age 5</li>
	<li>Gerber, Beech-Nut and Heinz baby food manufacturers</li>
	<li>Day care chains</li>
	<li>The Boys &amp; Girls Club</li>
	<li>Big Brothers Big Sisters</li>
	<li>Diaper delivery services</li>
	<li>Tutoring services</li>
</ul>
Pooling resources makes sense at a time when donor dollars are down, gas prices are rising, volunteers are often in short supply, and the baby boomers<b><i>, </i></b>who for years have been the major source of revenue and provision of such programs, will be the ones requiring them.

<b>11.  Let the Customer Be the Chef. </b>If their interest in TV cooking shows is any indication, many baby boomers and older adults enjoy cooking in their own kitchens! A recent Harris Poll showed over half (55 percent) of Baby Boomers and almost half (49 percent) of adults over age 65 watch cooking shows often or occasionally.  More than half of those who watch cooking shows say they have purchased food as a direct result of something they have seen on a show and more than one- third have purchased kitchen gadgets. Baby boomers are more likely than other age groups to have made these purchases, with 60 percent purchasing food and 41 percent buying kitchen gadgets.

More than just the “title” of a book that taught baby boomers and their mothers to cook, the <i>joy of cooking</i> is a key reason behind the popularity of cooking shows as well as cooking schools and restaurants where customers become chefs.   From casual steakhouses where diners grill their own meat to upscale restaurants like Chicago’s Cook Au Vin or Flat Top Grill where patrons prepare and eat their own traditional French dishes or Asian Fusion feasts, an increasing number of restaurants are offering customers the opportunity to prepare and cook their own meals. <b><i></i></b>

Rather than a chore to be completed, many baby boomers and seniors view cooking as way to express their creativity and ensure they are getting fresh, nutritious foods.  Thus, given the choice, some may very well choose the delivery of fresh ingredients and easy recipes rather than meals that are prepared for them in advance. For seniors who are cognitively able to follow recipes and use electrical appliances, giving them the opportunity to prepare their own meals – from ingredients already organized in advance in an effort to minimize cutting, chopping and measuring -- can offer a sense of independence and achievement.

Catering to this same “do-it-yourself” attitude may also be an option for congregate dining centers, whether that means offering something as simple as a salad bar or taco bar, where clients can build their own meals or providing fresh ingredients that seniors can take home to prepare their own meals. In the case of the latter scenario, the food service provider could choose several recipes and offer ingredients to mature adults, allowing them to prepare those dishes on-site.  In addition, clients should be given the opportunity to share recipes and ideas with other congregate dining customers, fostering both independence and social interaction, two facets that are often lacking in seniors lives.

Taking this a step further, a food service provider could work with congregate dining centers to offer cooking classes, which might rekindle the joy of cooking for widows, who once enjoyed and took pride in cooking for their families.  Classes could focus on simple “single-serving” meals or “several-portion” dishes that freeze well. After class, clients would have the opportunity to sit down with one another and enjoy the meal they prepared together

Cooking classes also open the door to other partnerships – for example, with television cooking shows and celebrity chefs.  Perhaps cooking programs could provide “senior-friendly” recipes or donate a percentage of sales from cookbooks or product sales to eliminate senior hunger.  Cooking programs might begin to occasionally feature <i>cooking- for-one</i> or <i>cooking-for-seniors</i> segments and inform food service providers in advance of menus and ingredient lists, so that seniors who watch the program could have that week’s ingredients – and quite possibly any gadgets used in preparing the meal – delivered to their home.

<b>12.  Going Green – and Organic.</b> Whether they’re buying organic foods or recycling aluminum cans and newspapers, baby boomers are not only interested in what goes into their own bodies – but into the environment as well.  A recent survey by Harris Interactive found that baby boomers and older Americans are more likely to recycle than adults 30 and younger. The 62-plus age group leads all other segments of the population with 81 percent having reported that they regularly recycle something in their home<b><i>, </i></b>be it aluminum cans, paper, glass or plastic.

According to “Shopping for Health,” a report by the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and <i>Prevention</i> magazine, younger baby boomers lead all other age groups in the purchase of organic foods, with 57 percent of them buying organic foods regularly.

A 2010 survey by Harris Interactive found that 27 percent of baby boomers say that more than a quarter of their grocery purchases are organic. This marks a 7 percent increase from 2009.

The Shopping for Health report also cites the growing demand for foods that are both healthful and environmentally friendly as key drivers of organic food sales.  More than eight in ten (81 percent) people who purchase organic foods regularly indicated they do so for their nutritional value; 77 percent cite freshness as a reason for purchasing organic foods and 67 percent mention a desire to promote long-term health.  Furthermore, many believe that organic foods just taste better!  In fact, ___ percent of Bateman Senior Meals survey respondents stated that they believed adding organic food choices would improve the taste and nutritional value of their meals

Because of the volume of food and packaging, and the resources used to prepare and deliver food, a food service company that serves organic foods and uses environmentally friendly practices could make a positive impact on the environment and position itself as a leader in this area.

In addition, a number of organizations offer a “Green Seal of Approval” for businesses that meet certain criteria in promoting environmental sustainability. Three of the most prestigious are the Green Seal Certification awarded by Green Seal,  a non-profit organization that uses science-based programs to empower consumers, purchasers and companies to create a more sustainable world; Green America’s Business Seal of Approval,  awarded by Green America, a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to harnessing the economic power of consumers, investors and businesses to promote social justice and environmental sustainability; and the Good Housekeeping’s Green Seal.

Examples of potential environmentally-friendly practices within the HCBS industry might include:
<ul>
	<li>Using hybrid vehicles for meal deliveries</li>
	<li>Packaging meals in recycled and recyclable materials that would be returned to the driver or placed in prominently marked receptacles at congregate dining centers</li>
	<li>Creating gardens on the grounds of community centers where clients could grow fruits, vegetables and herbs - using the food they grow as ingredients in the meals served and table scraps for mulch.</li>
</ul>
Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland is already taking steps to go green by implementing its Green Building Project, designed to reduce energy consumption so that future savings to the organization’s operating budget can be directed toward increased meal production and delivery costs to serve an anticipated growth in the number of their projected homebound clients by 2020.

Adoption of such programs and practices by other meal service providers would demonstrate that their organizations are not only concerned with containing costs to serve more seniors, but also with preserving the earth’s resources for generations to come.

<b>What’s ahead?</b>

Like leisure suits and rotary phones, the nutrition program of our grandparents’ day has become passé.  As the grandchildren of the program’s original clients approach retirement age themselves and the explosion of the senior population is imminent, it’s crucial that home and community based meal service providers take steps to both address the vulnerabilities of this growing market and capitalize on its strengths. Home and community based meal service providers must take into account the differences that exist within the various segments and cohorts of our senior adult population – including ethnicity, dietary needs, interests and income levels. By doing so, they can develop a parallel line of programs with diverse offerings that provide what essentially all mature adults want and deserve: nutritious, appetizing food served by someone who cares -- and perhaps a little fun!  <b><i></i></b>

1067,"Getting Well Without the Wait","For a generation who is raising our families on microwaved meals and managing our retirement accounts on our smart phones, waiting - especially for health care - has become unacceptable. Accustomed to conducting our business by email and voice mail, purchasing our groceries via the express aisle and driving to work in the HOV lane, we expect the same speed and ease from our health care. Thanks to new and developing technology, that's exactly what we're starting to get. When it comes to medicine in the <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/30-bonus-years/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">30 Bonus Years</a>, convenience will be key, and less will be more. Less invasive surgeries. Less recovery time. Less trial-and-error. Less inconvenience. Less time filling out medical forms and less delay waiting for test results.

<strong>Less invasive surgeries.</strong> In the 1980s, we were amazed when many surgeries that traditionally required a long incision in the knee could be performed through a few small incisions using tiny tools, a lighted scope and a video screen. Today, the use of what is commonly referred to as 'minimally invasive surgery' has extended to many other areas, including some abdominal and cardiac procedures, speeding recovery time and making life-enhancing procedures available to people who might otherwise not be able to withstand traditional surgery. In the future, even faulty heart valves will be replaced routinely with little (or no!) incisions. In a <a href=""http://www.emoryhealthcare.org/medicaladvances/heart-vascular-etma/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation.html"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">procedure</a> pioneered by Emory University in Atlanta, surgeons are replacing defective aortic valves through a catheter inserted in the groin. In other cases, the use of <a href=""http://www.davincisurgery.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">robotic-assisted surgery</a> for gynecologic and prostate surgeries are not only minimizing incisions and trauma, but also allowing the surgeon to operate with more precision than in traditional surgeries.

Perhaps the least invasive ""surgery"" is not surgery at all, but a technique that uses a high-dose radiation, delivered with pinpoint precision, to destroy tumor cells without harming surrounding tissues. <a href=""http://www.cyberknife.com/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">CyberKnife® technology</a> provides hope for patients whose tumors were once considered untreatable because of their proximity to critical structures such as the spine or brain. Unlike traditional surgery it's apparently painless and, as opposed to traditional radiotherapy, it doesn't require the patient to be completely still or undergo weeks of treatment.

<strong>Less trial-and-error prior to medical treatment. </strong>While treating complex diseases often requires a trial-and-error approach, advances in genetics will enable doctors to determine which medication - or combination of medicines - will work best for an individual before the first dose is given. This field of medicine, referred to as personalized or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient-centered_care"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">patient-centric medicine</a>, individualizes the treatment specifically for a particular patient in an effort to achieve the greatest benefits of treatment with the least risk of side effects. Doctors are beginning to use personalized medicine in debilitating diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancers, where genetic information from the patient is used to target treatment. When treating cancers, <a href=""http://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff_directory/staff_display.aspx?DoctorID=18415"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Thomas A. Samuel, MD</a>, associate professor of medicine in hematology/oncology at the Cleveland Clinic Florida, predicts that doctors will soon be able to put a piece of tumor tissue into a device that will evaluate it and recommend the best treatment regimen for that<em>specific</em> tumor.

<strong>Less inconvenience.</strong> Let's face it, getting sick can be pretty inconvenient. Getting treated can be even more inconvenient, especially if that requires medical tests and procedures and the care of a specialist. That's why some health systems, including <a href=""http://www.wellstar.org/pages/default.aspx"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WellStar</a> are turning to health parks. <a href=""http://www.wellstar.org/locations/pages/wellstar-acworth-health-park.aspx"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Health parks</a> are bringing to health care what malls brought to shopping in the 1970s, providing free parking and easy access to services like primary care providers, specialists, laboratory and X-ray services, physical therapy, pharmacies, fitness centers and out-patient surgery centers.

Even better, new smart phone apps could eliminate the need for some office visits altogether. Connected to a medical device, an Internet-enabled smart phone will allow patients to measure blood pressure, heart rhythms, glucose levels or other vital signs and transmit the results to their physician. For people with chronic health conditions that require regular monitoring vital information could be transmitted daily or even more frequently enabling the physician to detect problems that need immediate attention. In addition, you can access online doctor consultations and receive a comprehensive diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan from websites like <a href=""http://www.memd.me/"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MeMD</a>.

<strong>Less forms, less waiting.</strong> People who grow weary of filling out the same information again and again - personal information, insurance information, medical history, you know the drill - will find some relief when all medical records go electronic. Many large medical centers are currently making the leap to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record"" target=""_hplink"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">electronic records</a>, which will make one medical record available wherever you go - your primary physician's office, your local hospital's operating room or even an emergency room halfway across the country. The shift to completely electronic records promises to reduce costs and duplicate tests and procedures as well as waiting time for test results. Once tests are completed results are posted in your secure electronic record, which you can check online or have sent to your smart phone.

These examples of new and emerging technology only scratch the surface. While it is difficult to predict what lies ahead we can assume medical care will be faster, more convenient and more efficient than what we have now. After all, baby boomers are a busy bunch. They will demand it.

1079,"Save Big – Just by Being a Senior","I recently wrote a blog about great senior discounts and it was met with overwhelming interest and response!  But there are many other areas where seniors need not spend more. In fact, thousands of establishments across the U.S. will give you bargains on goods and services simply for meeting a certain age milestone – usually 55, 60 or 65, but in some cases as early as 50.

Wondering what all you can get at a discount?  Here is just a sample of the bargains available for the asking.

<b>Travel </b>– Finally have time to travel? From transportation to lodging, trips can become more affordable with senior discounts. Here is a list of the airlines taht will currently you incentives to fly (since everyone asks about travel discounts this section is the focus!):
<ul>
	<li><a href=""http://www.airfrance.us/cgi-bin/AF/US/en/common/home/home/HomePageAction.do"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a>: Senior fares are reserved for passengers 60 years of age or older within metropolitan France. Proof of age must be shown, and these tickets may be changed at no charge or refunded in certain conditions. They can be reached at 1-800-237-2747.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.aa.com/i18n/netSAAver/seniorFares/seniorFares.jsp&amp;locale=es_ES"" target=""_blank"">American Airlines</a>: Senior citizen fares are offered in some American, American Eagle and American Connection domestic markets for seniors ages 65 or older. Travelers should call American Airlines at 1-800-433-7300.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.delta.com/planning_reservations/plan_flight/online_reservations/fares_ticketing_rules/index.jsp"" target=""_blank"">Delta</a>: While offering senior discounts on certain itineraries, they aren’t available online, so travelers should call 1-800-221-1212 to check eligibility.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.delta.com/planning_reservations/plan_flight/flight_partners/delta_shuttle/index.jsp"" target=""_blank"">Delta Shuttle</a>: Senior fares are offered for travelers ages 62 and above. Delta Shuttle operates 16 daily flights between New York and Boston, and 15 daily flights between New York and Washington, D.C., Monday through Friday. Call reservations at 800-221-1212 and tell the agent that you are interested in the senior fares or check with an agent at any Delta ticket office.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/unique-travel-needs/seniors/index-pol.html"" target=""_blank"">Southwest Airlines</a>: Discount fares are available to those 65 years or older. For details on fares and limitations, call 1-800-I-FLY-SWA (1-800-435-9792). As an additional benefit, senior fares are also fully refundable on Southwest.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.united.com/"" target=""_blank"">United Airlines</a>: United offers senior citizen discounts in certain markets. Contact United’s reservations department at 1-800-241-6522 to find out if a senior discount is applicable for a particular flight.</li>
</ul>
Some airlines don’t offer discounts on flights, but have partnership agreements offering senior discounts on hotels, rental cars, and attractions and events. Organizations like <a href=""http://www.aarp.org/benefits-discounts/travel-discounts/"" target=""_blank"">AARP</a> have an active discount travel program that covers car rentals, hotels, tours, and cruises, so check them out before booking.

<b> </b>

Even if you don’t see what you’re looking for here, find what you want and then ask about a discount. Senior discounts have become so common that it never hurts to ask for one – whether the establishment you visit promotes one or not. Most places will take your word for it if you say you’re a senior, but carry along your picture ID and AARP card, if you have one, just in case.

1085,"Menopause & Exercise: Dr. A Q&A","Although I have yet to experience ""the change of life"" myself (<em>it's knocking on the door!!!</em>)...as a Gerontologist I'm very often asked about it and most commonly whether exercise will help make the journey just a little bit easier! In my opinion (<em>and many others</em>) exercise is a natural <em>elixir</em> for most physical (and many emotional) challenges women face. I recently read a great <a href=""http://www.longevitysage.com/the-exercise-elixir/"" target=""_hplink"">article</a> by <a href=""http://www.longevitysage.com/the-exercise-elixir/"" target=""_hplink"">Peter Ragnar </a>that asks the question: ""Is exercise an elixir that can add years to your life and life to your years?""....Peter cites interesting research throughout the article that certainly endorses this theory.

Menopause can be a difficult time in a woman's life - both emotionally and physically. Fortunately, a program consisting of regular exercise can help enhance your life and improve your overall well-being. In fact, lots of credible <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Excerpt_from_Mind_Over_Menopause.htm"" target=""_hplink"">research</a> has been conducted with findings that firmly support the idea that physical activity is one of the best antidotes to the challenges that often present themselves due to menopause.

<strong>Why is a women's emotional and physical health compromised during menopause?</strong>
Emotionally, one of the biggest challenges that women must face is the fact that they are no longer fertile. For some women this is a relief, but for others - particularly those who never had children, but wanted them - there may be a period of grieving. Even for women who have happily completed their families, menopause can be a sign associated with getting older, which many folks in our 'youth obsessed' culture may find difficult to accept. The hormone changes that occur during menopause can also contribute largely to mood swings or feelings of depression and anxiety. Physically, menopause can be difficult not only because of the hot flashes and other short-term symptoms it causes, but because the loss of estrogen can put women at risk for a diverse range of health problem.

<strong>How can exercise influence menopausal symptoms?</strong>
<a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Excerpt_from_Mind_Over_Menopause.htm"" target=""_hplink"">Research</a> suggests that being physically active can reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats and sleep disturbances. Research also reveals that exercise has a positive effect on mood and can be useful for the depression that often coincides with ""the change of life."" Exercising in the morning may improve your sleep at night and exercise can certainly be one of the best defenses against the weight gain many women experience as they get older. The many <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/exercise-for-seniors/"" target=""_hplink"">benefits</a> of regular exercise may include boosting your mood, strengthening your heart, improving your sleep and even promoting bone density.

<strong>How can your fat-to-muscle ratio and BMI affect how you feel during perimenopause and menopause? </strong>
As we age our fat-to-muscle ratio increases and we tend to lose muscle mass and add fat - particularly around the abdomen. This so-called visceral fat, which turns our bodies from a pair to an apple shape, has been linked to an increased risk of type II diabetes, heart disease, gallbladder problems and even breast cancer. Carrying around extra fat and less muscle may or may not directly affect body mass index (BMI), but it will likely affect your risk of certain health problems, and it can also impact the way you feel. You may be more sluggish and have difficulty doing some of the things you did when you were leaner and in better shape (<em>of course, some of that is to be expected due to normal aging</em>). As fat shifts from your thighs and hips to your abdomen and upper body, you may notice your waistband and tops are feeling tighter, even if the scales aren't showing you have gained weight.

<strong>What are your top tips for women who are beginning an exercise routine during menopause? </strong>
The main consideration is to play it safe. Exercise should be about making you healthy, not putting you at risk of an injury! This means you're going to need a little longer warm-up time than you did when you were younger. Allow about 10 minutes to warm up gradually - walking slowly, stretching, for example - before an exercise session. You should also avoid any exercises that may be unsafe - such as jarring exercises like jogging, jumping or high-impact aerobics if you have bone or joint problems. You can't get fit instantly - it is going to take time. I would also recommend that women make exercise enjoyable. Experiment with different types of exercise - dancing, walking, or working in the garden - until you find something you really like. Try taking classes where you can meet new people or arrange to walk with a friend. Mix up your exercise program to make it interesting - maybe dancing one day and <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/yoga-for-longevity/"" target="" hplink"">yoga</a> the next. I recently wrote a <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/boomer-fitness-gadgets/"" target=""_hplink"">blog</a> about new fitness gadgets and apps that will help you mix it up a bit.

<strong>What are the best forms of exercise for women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s? </strong>
Staying physically active consistently is more important than engaging in any particular form of exercise; however, women in their 40s, 50s and 60s should make it a point to engage in three different forms of exercise:

• <strong>Aerobic/ cardiovascular</strong>. This type of exercise, which includes walking, jogging, cycling, tennis, aerobics, working out on a elliptical machine - strengthens the heart and lungs and burns calories to help with weight loss or maintenance.
• <strong>Strengthening.</strong> Exercises such as working out with dumbbells, resistance bands or exercise machines are helpful for strengthening muscles and bones and increasing metabolism to help with weight management.
• <strong>Flexibility/stretching/range of motion.</strong> Stretching exercises, yoga and pilates can help keep our aging bodies more flexible and they can be particularly helpful for improving (or maintaining) joint function if joints are affected by arthritis.

Beyond this, the particular exercises women do should be based on their likes and any health problems they might have. For example, women who have bad knees should avoid running or jogging, which would put extra stress on their knees. Women with osteoporosis (brittle bones) should avoid activities such as bicycling or sports that could put them at risk of impact that could break a bone. The best exercise is one you enjoy and will do regularly.

<strong>How can women minimize the loss of muscle as they age? </strong>
Heed the old saying ""use it or lose it."" If you don't use your muscles you will lose muscle mass. For that reason, strengthening exercises are particularly important for women in their 40s and beyond. This includes working out with dumbbells, weight machines or resistance bands. For women who are just getting started with strengthening exercises or who have health concerns, I would recommend working with a physical therapist or personal trainer who can recommend a program specifically focused on <em>your </em>needs.

Remember....whatever exercise program you decide to embrace, always check with your physician before you begin to make sure it is appropriate for your lifestyle.

If left untreated, problems can get worse.  Hearing loss can affect your life in many ways.  You may miss out on talks with friends and family.  On the telephone, you may find it hard to hear what the caller is saying.  At the doctor's office, you may not catch the doctor's words.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/esvZ4MTswwc?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

A study by hearing experts at <a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_accelerates_brain_function_decline_in_older_adults"">Johns Hopkins</a> indicates that there are more serious side effects that have been routinely associated with hearing loss.  These include:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Depression and isolation are more common among individuals with hearing loss</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Those with mild hearing loss are twice as likely to develop dementia, and this risk increases with the severity of the hearing loss</strong></li>
	<li><strong>On average, older adults with hearing loss develop a significant impairment in their cognitive abilities 3.2 years sooner than those with typical hearing</strong></li>
</ul>
Sometimes hearing problems can make you feel embarrassed, upset, and lonely.  It's easy to withdraw when you can't follow a conversation at the dinner table, in a restaurant or on the telephone.  It's also easy for friends and family to think you’re confused, uncaring, or difficult, when the problem may be that you just can't hear as well.

If you have trouble hearing, there is help.  Start by seeing your doctor or a hearing specialist in your area.  Depending on the type and extent of your hearing loss, there are many treatment choices that may enhance your ability to hear immediately.

There are lots of great products on the market that may be helpful if you’re hard of hearing and just need a little assistance throughout your day.  Assistive technology helps people who are deaf and hard of hearing to live more independently.  Below are a few examples of what is currently available.

1095,"Great Exercise Programs for the 50+","Well it's that time of year and New Years resolutions are in full motion today!  As usual one of the resolutions high on the list is how to get fit and healthy.  I've received SO many ""health related"" questions over the last week that I thought I would post one about a couple of new ""boomer/senior specific"" exercise programs that have been introduced to the market.  Below is a Dr. Alexis readers question and my response.  If any or you have tried either of these exercise programs and have any suggestions/ideas that will help our reader make a thoughtful choice please submit them to <a href=""mailto:info@abramson.com"">info@abramson.com</a> or leave a note in the comments section below!  Many thanks in advance...YOU are always our best resource!

<em><strong>Hi Dr. Alexis,</strong></em>

<em><strong>I'm writing to ask your opinion about two classes that are offered at my local gym.  Since I recently got a basic membership level (so I could use the indoor track to walk FitBit mileage in the cold winter), I received their brochure about exercise classes.  Here are the two that caught my attention: T-Tapp and MeltMethod.  Do you know anything about these methods - and do you have an opinion?  Thanks!</strong></em>

<strong>A.</strong>  Hello and Happy New Year!!!  Let me first say I've not personally tried either of these programs - I've heard of them both and can provide some insight I gleaned from reaching out to a couple of my colleagues who work specifically in the 60+ health and fitness arena.  That being said, here are my thoughts regarding the two exercise programs you asked me to review.

<a href=""http://t-tapp.com/""><b>T-Tapp: </b></a> I like this program because Teresa Tapp has created both a ""general"" class and one that is more well suited for the ""mature"" population.  Personally I feel this is important - there is no doubt that one can attend a general exercise class but our bodies and range of motion do change as we age (it's inevitable!) so it makes sense to be kind to ourselves and exercise at a level that will enhance our health - yet maintain a safe level of exertion.  The senior fit program also focus on areas that are critical as we age - maximizing muscle activation, circulation and lymphatic health, etc. (she calls it a Brain-Body Fitness Workout!)….Every exercise was apparently designed to improve strength, flexibility and heart health, as well as increase energy and decrease inflammation.  They say that ""its special sequence of mindful movements combined with leverage isometrics will help your body rebuild from the inside out, improve posture and build better balance"" - all very important areas to focus on as we age.  My colleagues say that the folks they works with really like this program and appreciate the changes that were incorporated to make it a ""SAFE"" workout at any age!

<b><a href=""/http://www.meltmethod.com/"">MeltMethod:</a>  </b>This exercise regime seems to be extremely focused on reducing aches and pains associated with chronic conditions and stress (i.e. inflammation!).  I don't know your current level of fitness or your health status - but if stress and pain are problems you face this may be a great addition to your workout routine.  The website indicates that ""MELT brings your body back to a more ideal state by directly enhancing body awareness, rehydrating connective tissue, and decreasing stuck stress that accumulates from daily living"" - sounds good to me!  One person who tried the program said ""the first time you MELT, you can see and feel a difference – and over time, you can transform how your body looks and feels"" - also sounds good to me!  The exercise experts I talked to said it certainly can't hurt to incorporate MELT into your workouts because it is a proactive approach to getting a jump start on reducing the inflammation that is caused by the wear and tear we've all put on our bodies over decades of living life to its fullest!

I'm not sure this suggestion makes sense for your busy schedule but I would truly recommend that you try to incorporate both programs into your workout routine.  It seems to me that since MELT supposedly only takes 10 minutes to complete perhaps it could be done in addition to T-Tapp or you could do each program on alternate days.  Otherwise, I would suggest you take one program on this time and the other the next time and decide what YOU think - we are all at such different fitness levels and dealing with our individual ""aches and pains"" (<i>some days more than others</i>) so at some level it becomes a very personal choice.

Hope this helps at least a little bit!  I would be very interested in hearing which program you choose and your feedback.

<strong><em>Cheers to your health, happiness, wealth and wisdom!</em>  <em>Dr. Alexis</em></strong>

1100,"Caffeine Sharpens Your Memory???","<strong><em>I just read some interesting new research in the latest edition of <a href=""http://theweek.com"">THE WEEK</a>....I thought I would share it with all of you....It was a fairly small study but it might make that morning ""cup of joe"" taste even better!!!!</em></strong>

Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world for lots of reasons, including that it gives people a pleasant lift in the morning. New research shows that it also helps their memory. Researchers had 160 people who were not regular coffee drinkers look at pictures of objects; five minutes later they gave them either a placebo or a tablet containing 200 milligrams of caffeine—about the amount contained in a strong cup of coffee. The next day, participants were shown a broader set of images and asked to identify which ones were new, old, or similar. The caffeinated group was more likely to recognize slight differences in the pictures, such as a yellow rubber duck that was fatter than the one they’d seen the day before. “Without these tricky similar items, we would have found no effect of caffeine,” University of California, Irvine, neuroscientist Michael Yassa tells <a href=""http://forbes.com/""><i>Forbes.com</i></a>. “However, using these items requires the brain to make a more difficult discrimination—what we call pattern separation, which seems to be the process that is enhanced by caffeine.” It’s that form of memory that people use, for example, to recall where they last parked the car. Caffeine’s effect depends on the dosage, however: Researchers found that 100-milligram tablets didn’t improve memory, while 300-milligram doses caused headaches and jitteriness.",,"2020-01-28 15:17:07",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/caffeine-sharpen-memory/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/theweek.jpg,theweek,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/theweek.jpg,,Caregiving|Longevity,,,4,86,,,,,,2259,,,,,,,1054,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",-,2014-01-28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",caffeine-sharpen-memory,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 18:07:15",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1102,"Products to Help You Stay Independent","Independence is paramount in our day-to-day lives, so it's no surprise that the fear of losing one's independence -- especially among the elderly -- is substantial.  In fact, research suggests that over ninety-five percent of people 75 and older say they want to stay in their homes and live independently <i>indefinitely</i>.

As we age, we all notice a certain amount of physical decline. Whether this change is pronounced or barely noticeable varies from person to person, but eventually all of us need a little help in our daily tasks. For an independent individual, even the mildest changes in physical ability can be extremely frustrating.  Hopefully these products will allow you to continue to live your life to the fullest in a safe environment.",,"2014-02-12 16:39:28",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=1102,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/266_Grandma_Motorcycle.png,266_Grandma_Motorcycle,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/266_Grandma_Motorcycle.png,,"Lifestyle|Longevity|Marketing to Boomers",,,4,86,,,,,,6586,,,,,,,931,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",products-help-stay-independent,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 18:07:03",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1106,"Caring for Someone with Alzheimer’s","The latest statistics reveal that one in three people will die with some form of Alzheimer’s disease or some other form of dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease recently escalated to become the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. It is estimated that five million people presently live with the disease, causing an estimated 210 billion dollars in health care costs each year.  <strong>One person is diagnosed every 76 seconds!!!  </strong>I can't think of more compelling data to support the fact that this is <em>clearly</em> a crisis that needs more attention and funding moving forward.

Approximately 15 million individuals are caring for a person with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) or another type of dementia in the U.S. Although memory loss is the most common symptom, others include confusion, lack of orientation and changes in personality and behavior. Individuals with AD require escalating levels of care, management and provisions for their safety. Because the disease slowly gets worse, caregivers often spend a very long time in the caregiving role.

A recent survey found that 25% of those caring for someone with Alzheimer’s provide on average 40 hours of care weekly with about 75% performing physically demanding personal care including bathing, feeding and bathroom assistance.  Understandably, 40% of these caregivers reported high levels of emotional stress, particularly those who were working full or part-time; last year two-thirds of working caregivers missed work because of caregiving responsibilities and 8% turned down promotions.  It has been estimated that unpaid Alzheimer’s Disease caregivers provide an economic asset to our society worth almost $83 billion.

To support these caregivers, the <a href=""http://www.alzheimers-research.org"">Alzheimer’s Research Foundation</a> offers caregivers assistance through education, services, research and advocacy programs; such programs are at local, state and national levels. There is also funding available to assist family caregivers under the<a href=""http://www.aoa.gov""> National Family Caregiver Support Program</a> (NFCSP).  The <a href=""http://www.alzfdn.org"">Alzheimer's Foundation of America</a> offers the following tips for success as you give the best care possible for a loved one with Alzheimer’s.
<p align=""center""><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Alzheimer’s Caregiving Strategies for Success</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Educate yourself about the disease.</b> Read books, attend workshops and consult with healthcare professionals.</li>
	<li><b>Learn caregiving techniques.</b> Key areas are communication skills, safety concerns, managing behavioral challenges and activities of daily living.</li>
	<li><b>Understand the experience of your loved one.</b> Adjust your expectations. Be patient and kind.</li>
	<li><b>Avoid caregiver burnout.</b> Make time for yourself. Join caregiver support groups. Pursue interests beyond your caregiving role, such as exercise, hobbies, journaling and art.</li>
	<li><b>Maintain your own physical and mental health.</b> Exercise, respite and other activities can reduce stress. Seek medical help if there are signs of depression.</li>
	<li><b>Discuss the situation with family and friends.</b> Support systems are critical, especially when those you are caring for have a chronic condition which could potentially be long term.</li>
	<li><b>Participate in cognitively stimulating activities with your loved one.</b> Listening to music, doing word puzzles and partaking in memory games can easily be done at home.</li>
	<li><b>Foster communication with physicians.</b> Be involved in your loved one's medical care. Ask questions about the progression of the disease, express concerns and discuss treatment options.</li>
	<li><b>Take care of financial, legal and long-term care planning issues.</b> Try to involve your loved one in decision-making, if they are still capable of providing input, and consider their wishes related to future care and end-of-life issues.</li>
	<li><b>Smile.</b> Kindness, humor and creativity are essential parts of caregiving. Hugs, hand massages and other gentle physical contact will help your loved one feel connected and loved.</li>
	<li><b>Think positively.</b> Focus on your loved one's remaining strengths and enjoy your relationship while you are still able to.</li>

1121,"World Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) Day","<a href=""http://ish-world.com/news/a/World-Hypertension-Day-2014-17-May/"">World Hypertension Day</a>, celebrated annually on May 17th, serves as a formal occasion to emphasize opportunities to improve prevention and control of hypertension – also known a high blood pressure. According to the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/infographic.htm"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> hypertension is a serious health issue affecting 67 million Americans, that’s one in every three adults and millions more teens and children.

<a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/basics/definition/con-20019580"">High blood pressure</a> is a common problem in which the force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually put you at risk for life threatening health conditions. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, the first and fourth leading causes of death for all Americans.  As highlighted in the recent <a href=""http://ish-world.com/news/a/World-Hypertension-Day-2014-17-May/"">global burden of disease study</a> increased blood pressure is the leading risk for death and disability around the world.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fnv-vgmz8QU?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Hypertension is a <a href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/silent+disease""> ""silent disease,""</a> often without warning signs or symptoms.  Fortunately, there’s more than medication that can help lower your blood pressure - making the proper lifestyle choices can help control blood pressure as well.  Incorporate these 5 tips into your daily routine to help properly control and monitor your blood pressure.
<p align=""center""><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">5 Tips to Control Hypertension</span></b></p>

<ol>
 	<li><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exercise on a Regular Basis</span></b>– In order to stay healthy it’s important to <i>get active </i>and maintain a healthy weight. Regular physical activity has been shown to reduce blood pressure and may bring you back to a safe level.  People who are physically active have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure -- <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/preventing-high-blood-pressure"">20% to 50% lower</a> -- than people who are not active. You don't have to be a triathlete to benefit from physical activity. According to the <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/PreventionTreatmentofHighBloodPressure/Physical-Activity-and-Blood-Pressure_UCM_301882_Article.jsp"">American Heart Association</a> even light activities, if done on a regular basis, can help lower your risk.  The general rule is that it’s best to aim for 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.</li>
 	<li><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Stick to a Healthy Diet</span></b> – According to <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/preventing-high-blood-pressure"">webmd.com</a> being overweight can make you two to six times more likely to develop high blood pressure than if you are at your desirable weight. Even small amounts of weight loss can make a big difference in helping to prevent and treat high blood pressure.  While it’s okay to indulge occasionally, keep your diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products. Avoiding saturated fat and cholesterol, and reducing sodium can help reduce blood pressure.  Follow the <a href=""http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash/"">Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension</a> (DASH), a flexible and balanced eating plan, for a healthy diet and stable blood pressure.</li>
 	<li><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Incorporate Home Monitoring</span></b> – Don’t wait until your next doctor’s appointment; take readings at home with a remote blood pressure monitoring system such as the <a href=""http://www.ideallifeonline.com/products/bpmanager"">IDEAL LIFE BP Manager<b>™</b></a><b>.</b>  This product allows you to take a reading in the comfort of your home and transmit it directly to your physician.  By monitoring your blood pressure regularly <i>high </i>blood pressure is more likely to be detected before drastic health risks occur.  This reliable blood pressure monitor is an easy-to-use device that quickly and accurately measures upper arm blood pressure and heart rate, and automatically and wirelessly communicates that data to your healthcare team.</li>
 	<li><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduce Your Stress</span></b> – Stress has been routinely linked to potential increases in blood pressure. The <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/PreventionTreatmentofHighBloodPressure/Physical-Activity-and-Blood-Pressure_UCM_301882_Article.jsp"">American Heart Association</a> maintains that we can all fight stress by incorporating <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/StressManagement/FightStressWithHealthyHabits/Fight-Stress-with-Healthy-Habits_UCM_307992_Article.jsp"">healthy habits </a> into our busy lives.  When you’re feeling overwhelmed or anxious, consider meditating, getting a massage or practice a mindful low impact exercise like <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/yoga-for-longevity/"">yoga</a>.  Stress can make blood pressure go up, and over time may contribute to the cause of hypertension.  In today's fast-paced world filled with increasing demands, it's very important to <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/StressManagement/Stress-Management_UCM_001082_SubHomePage.jsp"">manage your stress level</a> in an effort to control your blood pressure.</li>
 	<li><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Watch What You Drink</span></b> – The <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/blood-pressure/faq-20058254"">Mayo Clinic</a> reports that if not consumed in moderation both caffeine and alcohol can raise your blood pressure by several points. To help prevent high blood pressure, and for overall health, the <a href=""http://www.drinkinmoderation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2010-alcohol-DG-tear-pad-Sep-24-2012.pdf"">""Dietary Guidelines for Americans""</a> recommends that you limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than two drinks a day for men and no more than one drink a day for women.  The <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/blood-pressure/faq-20058543"">Mayo Clinic</a> suggests that if you have high blood pressure you should ask your doctor whether you should limit or stop drinking caffeinated beverages. If you're concerned about caffeine's effect on your blood pressure, try limiting the amount of caffeine you drink to no more than two 12-ounce cups of brewed coffee.</li>
</ol>
According to <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm?names-dropdown="">webmd.com</a> less than half of those suffering from high blood pressure, 47 percent, have their condition under control.  Additional <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/infographic.htm"">research</a> indicates that when your blood pressure is high, you are 4 times more likely to die from a stroke, and you are 3 times more likely to die from heart disease.  By being proactive and monitoring your blood pressure on a regular basis, potential hypertension can hopefully be caught before more severe health conditions develop.

1155,"New Year/New You!  What's Your 2nd Act?","At the turn of the century our average life expectancy was around 45 - <em>today Americans can expect to live to be at least 75 years old</em> - that's thirty-plus additional years filled with lots of choices and decisions.  Navigating this virtually uncharted territory can be daunting.  Just remember - you're in control of aging successfully through your <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/30-bonus-years"">30 Bonus Years™</a> - especially when it comes to retirement!

Retirement is a transition that's generally filled with mixed emotions. You may feel like you’ve finally reached your professional stride and still have many productive years left, but the human resources department is suggesting you take a ""less-demanding"" position based on the results of your annual physical and length of time with the company. And then there’s the obvious route – leaving the active job market altogether <em>by choice</em>!  There’s so much to consider before making a permanent change in your employment status, including setting some new goals for your future and making sure you have the funds to achieve them.  Much like plotting an exciting roadway adventure - retirement also requires planning, especially during transition stages when you're scrambling for answers.

There's no doubt that being physically and mentally healthy (<i>and engaged</i>) means nothing if you don’t have enough money to support yourself through your <a title=""30 bonus years™"" href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/30-bonus-years"">30 bonus years</a>.  Clearly if you haven’t figured out your finances, make sure this task is a BIG part of the equation.  One <a title=""early retirement"" href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/downside-early-retirement-153836458.html"">downside </a>of early retirement is that a lot of people <i>don't</i> take the time to do the money math before they take the leap. “A good rule of thumb is: If you can't pay off your mortgage, you can't afford to retire,” according to Tom Sightings, a former publishing executive who was eased into early retirement in his mid-50s.  Tom frequently posts blogs on the <a href=""http://sightingsat60.blogspot.com/"">Sightings at 60</a> website where he covers health, finance, retirement and other concerns of Baby Boomers who realize that ""somehow they have grown up.""  When financially planning for the future it’s especially important to be prepared for unexpected big ticket items like healthcare expenses, accidents and illness.  Did you know that according to <a href=""http://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/health-care-costs-when-you-retire"">Fidelity Investments </a>a 65-year-old couple retiring in 2014 was estimated to need $220,000 (<i>out of pocket</i>) just to cover medical expenses throughout retirement - SCARY!?

<em><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/silver_lining/2011/03/dont_stop_working.html"">Never stop working</a></em> may just be the mantra that keeps you alive longer, and not just due to the extra money in the bank.  In their book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594630755/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594630755#reader_1594630755"">The Longevity Project</a> psychology professors Howard S. Friedman and Leslie R. Martin present end-of-life findings with surprising conclusions about the factors that sustain a long, rewarding life.  Friedman says ""fun can be overrated and stress can be unfairly blamed” which is an especially important point for those who contemplate retirement as decades filled with leisure and relaxation.  The encouraging link between continuing to <a href=""http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/Work%20Longer,%20Live_Healthier.pdf "">work and longevity</a> is exemplified in the Chianti region of Italy, located in Tuscany between the cities of Florence and Siena. In this wine region, the family-owned vineyards are often passed on from generation to generation. While the elders may leave the more taxing jobs to the youngsters, they never fully retire. The older members of the family continue to walk the rows of vines to make sure the grapes are in good condition and participate in tastings to ensure the quality of the wine, and they remain involved in important business decisions. Many locals claim it’s their ongoing daily involvement that is responsible for their exceptionally long and healthy lives.

Perhaps a smart way to approach your potential retirement is to transition into a softer job that provides a more meaningful reason to get out of bed in the morning. Seek to parlay your expertise into an advisory position or pursue a freelance job that keeps <em>you</em> in control of the time clock. For those of you who are ready to retire (or at least adjust your path) <a href=""http://internal-communication.com/miserable_worke/"">Zenployment</a>, a concept from Canada that is catching on in the states, might be the perfect option. This idea refers to any kind of work, including self-employment, that you choose to do after you retire from your regular career, with the goal aimed at <i>making a difference</i>.  Not only will Zenployment keep you active, but according to a report published in <a href=""http://longevity.about.com/od/lifelongrelationships/a/Volunteering-And-Longevity.htm"">Psychology and Aging</a> those who volunteer, or work in jobs where they feel they are <em>giving back,</em> are said to reduce their mortality risk by about 25%.

While you’re weighing your options, why not consider doing something for the sheer joy it brings? Consider offbeat choices, such as posing for portraits with kids as the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus, or perhaps conducting guided tours for a museum or historical attraction that you enjoy visiting. The rules and criteria that once defined your professional career may no longer exist, thereby clearing the way for something else that is completely different and perhaps outside your comfort zone. For instance, imagine the kick that a <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/31/american-apparel-model-_n_4701743.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009"">62 year old model</a> gets out of knowing she still has what it takes to generate consumer interest in lingerie - as she says ""<em>sexy has no expiration date</em>"" - LOVE IT!  Expect to see more senior spokespersons in the media, as the shift to target the incoming sixty-something age group increases.

So unless you’re prepared to give up your claim in the game of life, stay engaged in either a fun job or challenging and meaningful pursuit to stay sharp and ready for the adventures that await you in the 2nd act of your retirement, whatever you decide it should be!",,"2019-12-30 19:06:09",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/2nd-act-retirement/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seniors-jumping.jpg,seniors-jumping,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seniors-jumping.jpg,,Longevity,,,4,86,,,,,61,3112,,"retirement baby boomers, savings",,,,,1157,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",-,2014-12-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",2nd-act-retirement,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 18:05:16",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1203,"Have You Talked To Your Loved Ones about Your Finances?","<h3><span style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"">Many closest-knit families avoid discussing certain topics – <em>such as personal finances</em>. Even if discussing financial matters with loved ones seems uncomfortable, it’s extremely necessary in order to maintain proper management (<em>and avoid any confusion!</em>) about your money and other personal affairs as you age.  </span></h3>
Avoiding discussions around long term personal preferences will not only impact your financial matters but extends to all areas of your life such as living arrangements, caregiving choices, etc.  In fact, <a href=""http://www.nia.nih.gov/"">National Institute on Aging</a> (NIA) research cites that the medical care elderly receive at the end-of-life is often different from what they would choose if they had planned in advance.  Since your finances are directly tied to your health care and end-of-life wishes, review both with your family on an annual basis to make any necessary or desired modifications.

Research shows that an overwhelming majority of older adults who died with advance directives and instructions (<em>including in a living will or durable power of attorney for health care</em>) were less likely to die in a hospital or to receive aggressive care, or be subjected to decisions inconsistent with their wishes.

It’s best to start with little things, like asking a loved one to participate in the purchase of a new television - gradually expand to more critical tasks such as annual tax return filings, personal finance management needs and monitoring your bank accounts. The shift in responsibility is usually incremental and irreversible, and in truth, can escalate quickly once the process begins.

Make the tough decisions now, such as appointing a power of attorney, before they need to be acted on. When deciding to appoint someone, such as a spouse, sibling or other relative, make sure they are on-board with your choice and prepared to handle the responsibility with your best interest in mind.

You can delay the inevitable shift in financial control by reviewing your personal finances on a monthly basis and setting up auto-pay features to simplify monthly recurring bill management, such as utilities and insurance premiums. If you are a regular web surfer, opt for electronic billing to minimize your paper trail, especially during extended travel periods. Pay close attention to monthly statements for questionable billing changes and sign-up for account alerts to protect your identity, as seniors are often targets of identity theft.

End-of-life planning includes writing living wills, selecting a durable power of attorney for health care, and holding informal discussions with family members to protect from unwanted medical treatments should you become incapacitated and unable to express your preferences.  Discuss your wishes with your family well before you are simply too sick, tired, aged or incapable of implementing them regarding the division and distribution of your personal finances and estate and your medical priorities.

<a href=""http://www.agingwithdignity.org/five-wishes.php"">Five Wishes</a> is an initiative that simplifies the process with an efficient method that lets your family and doctors know several key decisions you want implemented on your behalf. Their website offers a user-friendly format to establish a living will and clarify your wishes regarding health care, medical treatment and other directives that affect your end-of-life management.

Equally at risk of losing perspective, are your financial directives for your valuables, properties, and other inheritables. Planning for long-term financial management is more effective when it is seen as an ongoing process of decision making, rather than the creation of a one-time, end-of-life, legal document.

The quality of your care is dependent on your financial status and should be examined closely to ensure your assets can support your care management and end-of-life choices. Review and update your plans on an annual basis with one or more trusted family members while there is no immediate need to exercise your wishes. To help break the ice, take the first step of writing down your preferences regarding key issues, such as health care, extended-care and financial management, and initiate the conversation with your loved-ones. Use online resources to keep your priorities in check, but most important of all - <i>make a plan.</i>",,"2015-02-02 18:02:56",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=1203,,,,,,,,"Your Money",,,4,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",talked-loved-ones-finances,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2018-03-16 16:26:06",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1217,"Does love really matter in retirement?","Long-term relationships and marriages start out with the best of intentions and are usually defined by romance, passion and commitment. Recognizing that there are <a href=""http://www.foryourmarriage.org/stages-of-growth-in-marriage/"">distinct stages of growth</a> necessary for a successful marriage may be the ticket to happily celebrating your golden years together. After settling into the routine of a happy marriage, the <em>reality-of-life</em> stage takes over and personality differences emerge. Couples that get past the usual conflicts that can arise long after exchanging vows tend to focus more on their common ground, and try not to sweat the differences.

We all know that marriage is about give and take. A successful commitment also requires trust, honesty and the ability to forgive each other for past mistakes. After decades of surviving through highs and lows, such as sickness, financial concerns, and family conflicts, a relationship built on mutual respect has a solid foundation to succeed through every stage, including retirement.

<a href=""http://firstthings.org/retirement-and-marriage"">Retirement and marriage</a> don’t always sync up as easily as love and marriage did in the beginning of your relationship and may require a period of adjustment. Without proper planning, it can turn into the relationship from hell that ends in divorce court.  Give your spouse, or significant other, the gift of space and time to adjust to this major lifestyle change. Honey-do lists and personal agendas should not define the start of retirement and can certainly wait a few months. Retirement timetables may not always be in total sync, as often one spouse exits the job market several months or years before the other. View the transitions as stair steps to testing the waters and preparing the boat for the dual journey ahead.

For you women out there - avoid the onset of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1021891/?page=1"">retired husband syndrome</a>, a recognized affliction that can disrupt the daily routine and order in a household and actually manifest in the form of physical and mental distress for some stay-at-home wives (<em>I'm quite sure it applies to stay at home husbands as well!</em>). When spouses are unaccustomed to spending countless hours together, they sometimes encounter gaps in communication and intimacy - two important building blocks of a relationship. This can be exasperated when a husband with decades of bread-winning behind him experiences a dramatic shift in his daily schedule that may leave many weekdays open with no specific destination or reason to venture out of the house. Suddenly thrust into full-time, domestic life, a retired husband may create additional work just by hanging out, while remaining oblivious to the extra mess he creates in the process, and thereby cause stress levels to rise within the household. Left unchecked, this type of scenario can sometimes lead to illness, conflicts and possible divorce.

To avoid the onset of conflict that comes with spending endless days and nights under the same roof, make a plan to share the brunt of domestic chores. Evaluate the household duties, such as yard work, cooking and cleaning to re-distribute lopsided chores that were performed with habitual ease throughout active career schedules, and which may require a revamp to accommodate less-demanding lifestyles and less-nimble bodies.

Since retirement is supposed to be fun, take the calendar out once a month to strategize enjoyable activities that give equal consideration to the individuals, as well as combined preferences, and strive to include several family-centered events in the itinerary. Separate vacations once in a while may help ease the confinement of too many hours spent under the same roof together while giving the relationship breathing room to appreciate each other’s absence.

The plus side of staying together for a lifetime is immeasurable. Besides offering emotional support through life’s tragedies, including sickness and the death of loved ones, the lingering effects are less painful when shouldered with a spouse. Marriages that stand the test of time through raising families and beyond are positioned to reap the benefits of their long-term commitment. Double-income families create double-income retirement and pension funds which can translate into living upgrades and more frequent travels.

By developing a watchdog approach for each other, longevity becomes a mutual goal for long-term success. Develop new habits with a buddy-system approach that keeps you both on track for fitness and diet goals. Watch for early signs of disease that your spouse may not easily notice, such as <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/tc/sleep-apnea-symptoms"">sleep apnea</a> or other sleep-related disorders, and become pro-active toward each other’s good health.

Discuss the changing landscape of the aging process with your spouse to ease the transition for both of you. Communication levels are triggered by <a href=""http://www.spousetime.com/quality-time-with-spouse.html"">sharing quality time</a> and meals together. For instance, breakfast is the perfect setting to mark the day’s beginning, plan trips, discuss current events and offer upbeat, emotional support for personal issues, such as fading eyesight and receding hairlines.

It’s an often-held belief that sex is a by-product of a fertile mind. Intimacy comes in many forms, including spooning beneath the blanket and giving each other mutual massages and back rubs. Physical contact keeps couples connected with empathetic hugs and shoulder squeezes that offer unspoken affirmation of the ‘<i>you’re okay – I’m okay’</i> validation we all appreciate. Aging well together includes a gradual shift in the closeness and intimacy levels that may have once defined your marriage.

Love takes on new meaning in later life, including the frequency of lovemaking. Although the fireworks may not go off every night, older couples can still ignite the fires of passion with great satisfaction. To maintain a healthy <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/iage/201304/sex-in-older-age"">sex life</a>, sync up your libido with your spouse and go for quality over quantity by arranging romantic trysts in your candlelit bedroom or perhaps by checking into a luxury hotel. Focus on each other’s good qualities and ignore the rest.

The key to longevity for most people is to remain happy and optimistic and enjoy the company you keep on a regular basis. Researchers in the Journal of Marriage and Family agree that when the happiness factor is present, basic needs, such as proper sleep and healthy diet become a natural component of couple longevity. Their findings offer proof that <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyadvice/10161482/Couples-who-do-not-argue-live-longer-study-finds.html"">couples who don't argue</a> live longer and happier lives. A team-effort approach to a relationship is particularly important in later years. Winning the race to the 100-year finish line requires a relationship tune-up once in a while, since you are both running on the same engine from start to finish.",,"2015-02-02 18:54:12",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=1217,,,,,,,,Lifestyle|Longevity,,,4,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",love-really-matter-retirement,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2018-03-16 16:25:44",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1218,"Will happier friends make you healthier?","Are you feeling ""disconnected"" even though you're always surrounded by people?  Do you feel like you have a million acquaintances but very few true friends?  If the answer is a resounding YES - you're not alone!  As a 50+ lifestyle expert people ask me all time how to put a little spice into their old friendships.  Lot of experts will tell you to clean the slate and get some new friends if the pizazz has died down.  Although I agree with that to a point, don't set aside those long term friendships until you are sure you're ready to let go - see if you can create a happier (<em>and subsequently healthier!</em>) relationship.

We are all social creatures at heart. The simple act of good conversation with a close friend can offer acceptance, understanding, compassion and even an occasional wake-up call when necessary. Those who regularly interact with their friends and peers are often the happiest and the healthiest, especially when social connections are maintained and preserved over the course of a lifetime.  And as we all know by now - happiness is important!  In fact, a study in the journal, “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences” revealed that older people who are happy have a 35 percent lower risk of dying over a five-year period than unhappy people - <em>good to know</em>!  Study researcher Andrew Steptoe, a professor at University College in London, says that, “Happiness could be a marker of some other aspect of people's lives which is particularly important for health.  For example, happiness is quite strongly linked to good social relationships, and maybe it is things like that that are accounting for the link between happiness and health.""  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594630755/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594630755#reader_1594630755"">The Longevity Project</a>, a book that sets out to ""expose what really impacts our lifespan-including friends, family, personality, and work"" backs this up by stating that those who have a large social network and good social relations, <em>live the longest</em>.

It is also common knowledge that those of us who enjoy helping others achieve even <em>greater</em> longevity when combined with good social relations.  In an article published in Psychology Today, entitled “<a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201305/social-connectivity-drives-the-engine-well-being"">Social Connectivity Drives the Engine</a>,” author, Christopher Bergland shares his findings. “There is a direct connection between social isolation, loneliness, and a potential downward spiral towards poor health.” John Cacioppo, a University of Chicago social psychologist and neuroscientist who studies the biological effects of loneliness, has found that loneliness is linked to dramatic increases in the stress hormone cortisol, hardening of the arteries (which leads to high blood pressure), inflammation in the body, and can diminish executive function, learning, and memory.  Social connections do lead to a healthier and happier you!

There's no doubt that we should utilize every method of communication that keeps us connected and engaged with close friends so do make use of the internet to stay in touch when physical interaction isn’t possible.  While you’re browsing your way through the web to post your latest photos or plot your next big adventure, consider using the resources at your disposal to stay abreast of your health. Research has shown that there are benefits for older adults <a href=""http://www.seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Features/2013/20131022_Older%20Adults%20Using%20the%20Internet%20are%20More%20Likely%20to%20Engage%20in%20Cancer%20Prevention%20Behavior.htm"">using the internet</a> as a source of information to help prevent cancer and other diseases.  A pro-active approach to your health can include keeping up-to-date on the latest medical advances and helping to assess your own health-related issues. Join health-oriented groups and frequent websites you trust to gain an ongoing grasp of products, policies and the latest advances that can directly affect your health. Add your name to the membership list of the sites you are attracted to in order to network with others with similar life events and to stay updated on changes that most affect you. Discover the benefits of social networking by opening the door to mutual online acquaintances that can eventually lead to real friendships.

Although Facebook and other social media websites provide a seamless digital interface to our social contacts, it's important that we also make a conscious effort to nurture our human bonds and sense of community.  It is the face-to-face contact and intimate human connections that engage our biological systems to preserve our well-being.  A <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/journal/1538-7755_Cancer_Epidemiology_Biomarkers_amp_Prevention"">study</a> published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention collected data from men and women aged 50 or older and found that those who use the internet are more likely to participate in screening for colorectal cancer, participate in physical activities, eat healthy, and smoke less, compared with those who do not use the internet.",,"2015-02-02 20:49:04",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=1218,,,,,,,,Lifestyle,,,4,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",time-new-friends,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2018-03-16 16:25:29",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1219,"Are you searching for a meaningful adventure?","In the quest for a meaningful life, consider a variety of worthwhile adventures that focus on broadening your perspective toward the aging process. A trip to Greece or Andorra may be the inspiration you need to coax a healthier lifestyle approach.  Speaking of Greece, consider adapting a philosophic approach to discovering authentic ways of aging. In the book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Travels-Epicurus-Journey-Island-Fulfilled/dp/0143121936"">Travels with Epicurus</a>, author Daniel Klein gives us an overview of some famous Greek philosophers’ thoughts on aging, while injecting some of his own insights. Klein states that “old age is a privilege to be savored, rather than a disease to be cured or a condition to be denied.”  Plato surmised that “<i>Life should be lived like a play</i>”…since…“<i>Man is God’s plaything</i>.”  Klein sums up the criteria necessary to craft a meaningful old age and agrees with Plato about not taking life too seriously, but also feels it is important to reflect on your life and realize the value of your own history. He also cites benefits from the enjoyment of spending quality time with family, and unplugging the clock to overcome the fear of running out of time, as helpful ways to live out a meaningful life.   If you haven't read this book - do yourself a favor and buy it immediately!  It's a fast yet powerful read.

If planning an adventure sounds appealing - a trip to the mountains might do the trick and a side benefit is that apparently <a href=""http://dalje.com/en-lifestyle/high-altitudes-may-increase-longevity/348197"">high altitudes promote long life</a>.  A study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found the top 20 counties with the highest life expectancy were in Colorado and Utah with an average mean elevation of 5,967 feet above sea level. Lower oxygen levels turn on certain genes and the study suggests those genes may change the way heart muscles function. New blood vessels form as a result of lower oxygen levels, which creates new pathways for blood flow into the heart. If living in a lower oxygen environment that prevails in high altitudes helps reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, it could lead the way to new clinical treatments that address those conditions.  Extreme challenges, such as snow skiing and mountain-climbing are worthy activities for high altitudes. If you’re new to the sport, seek out a qualified instructor and get your doctor’s approval first. Stretch the boundaries beyond your usual comfort zone to explore your potential wanderlust.

Adventure is all about excitement. A cross-country train trip or leisurely camping excursion might be just the ticket for keeping pace, yet slightly removed from the mainstream population. Buddy-up with a close relative or good friend or consider joining a travel club, such as <a href=""http://www.eldertreks.com/"">Eldertreks,</a> to spread your wings even further.  Travel can be expensive – <i>or not</i>! Depending on the specifics of your travel plans, costs associated with wanderlust can be minimized by planning ahead.  If you're retired US News and World Report offers these <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/on-retirement/2010/11/01/5-tips-for-affordable-travel-in-retirement"">tips for affordable travel</a> that can apply to retirees or anyone that is hoping to travel economically.

<b><i>Travel like an old pro:</i></b><b> <i>slow</i>.</b>  Retirees have more time to plan and shop around to take advantage of off-season discounts and travel dates that have lower fare prices and fewer crowds, such as cruises and sight-seeing tours.

<b><i>Shop around for discounts and deals</i></b><i>.</i> Seniors can benefit from extra discounts that may not be publicized regularly. Sign up for email alerts to receive information on the latest travel deals from your preferred airlines and hotels and take advantage of free air mile offers. Let your fingers to the research to get your best deals.

<b><i>Consider taking a full-time job with travel options</i></b><i>.</i> Search for a consulting job that sends you packing. Take advantage of the travel costs incurred by the company and extend the trip to explore new sites and nearby attractions.

Seniors have specific criteria when it comes to traveling. Here are a few general safety travel tips for Retirees from the <a href=""http://retirement-cafe.com/Retirement-Travel.html"">Retirement Cafe</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Leave the good jewelry at home.</li>
	<li>Confirm your travel plans and reservations before leaving home.</li>
	<li>Put your address both inside and outside of your luggage.</li>
	<li>Scrutinize hotel and restaurant bills, especially when traveling.</li>
	<li>Keep valuable documents and items inside carry-on luggage and in your possession.</li>
	<li>Opt for less-expensive luggage to downplay your social or financial status, especially when travelling abroad.</li>
	<li>Regardless of how far you go, the degree to which your next trek turns out to be pleasurable, adventurous, and satisfying will depend on how well you plan your trip.</li>
	<li>The quality of your journey will also depend on your ability to be spontaneous and how well you are able to maintain a positive attitude throughout.</li>
</ul>
Travel is a great way to re-ignite your inner-spark and expand your horizons. Seeing new places, learning about other cultures, and meeting new people opens your mind to possibilities. The splendor of exploring one-of-a-kind places like the Grand Canyon or going on a European railway adventure can enhance your life with a fresh thirst for adventure.

1220,"Are you sleepy ALL of the time?","A good night’s sleep is one of the most effective tools known to enhance mental and physical stamina. A chronic lack of sleep can be linked to certain symptoms, including poor concentration, dizziness, headaches, weight gain, depression and general fatigue throughout the day.  With maturity comes change, including the amount of time we are able to devote to regular sleep cycles.  Sleep deprivation may seem like a minor inconvenience, but it's much more than a nuisance!  In fact, research tells us that those with ongoing insomnia are at a higher risk for developing serious <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270120.php"">chronic illnesses</a>, such as Diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease.

According to the <a href=""http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/let-sleep-work-you"">National Sleep Foundation</a>, people 50 and over require between 7 to 9 hours of restful sleep each night to maintain good health and mental focus. The foundation points to specifics that can enhance the sleep mood.  To begin with, avoid alcohol, cigarettes and tobacco products since they are sleep disrupters, as is chocolate (<em>you know what they say…""everything in moderation""</em>). Of course, it’s important to eliminate caffeine prior to bedtime and in the late afternoon. Instead, reach for a healthy snack of yogurt or nuts to boost afternoon slumps. Caffeine-free coffee and tea can be substituted in moderation to minimize the jitters, or you may want to enjoy the benefits of drinking an herbal tea, such as chamomile, before bedtime to relieve stress and relax your muscles.  Celestial Seasonings even has an herbal tea called Sleepytime<b>®</b> - just typing the word name makes me drowsy!

Also, if possible, try to avoid the regular use of prescription or over-the-counter sleep aids to prevent dependency issues that could lead to depression. <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/tc/melatonin-overview"">Melatonin</a> may just do the trick to aid the sleep cycle with a natural approach - but, as always, it's best to talk to your doctor before adding any supplements to your routine.  Also, if you're going natural I hear lots of people spray <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/marek-doyle/help-me-sleep-magnesium-secret-to-sleep-problems_b_3311795.html"">magnesium oil</a> on the tops of their feet before they hit the sack - worth a try!

Try to turn your bedroom into a comfort zone that is conducive to restful sleep. Layer windows with functioning treatments, such as traversing draperies and operable blinds that can block out light when a daytime sleep-in is called for (this also tends to provide extra insulation during weather extremes). Place reading materials nearby with adequate lighting and comfortable back support to enhance restful sleep.  Resist the urge to leave your cell phone bedside, unless it is part of your security plan, and consider muting the ringer to avoid unwanted wake-up calls. If your bedroom includes a sitting area, you probably also have a TV. While enjoying the entertainment value it offers in the privacy of your bedroom is appealing, try to avoid depending on the TV as a crutch to help you fall asleep.  Instead, opt for listening to soft, instrumental music to relax your mind at bedtime.  And most definitely shut down your internet connection at least an hour before bedtime!  The National Sleep Foundation has compiled <a href=""http://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/six-tips-design-the-ideal-bedroom-sleep"">six easy-to-accomplish and cost-free tips</a> to help ensure that your bedroom environment is ideal for sleep. They say you should ""take the time to design a sleep-friendly bedroom environment so that you can wake up each morning feeling refreshed.""  Makes sense!

Although regular exercise is important, complete vigorous workouts at least 3 hours before hitting the sack. A warm bath and a glass of milk may sound a bit old fashioned, but folks claim that the combination before bed encourages slumber. Even an occasional beer before bedtime may help, since the <a href=""http://www.cantsleep.org/aids/hops.html"">hops</a> in most brews can ease digestion and soothe stomach spasms, while promoting sleep. I tried it, I liked it, <em>just sayin'</em>…..On another note, avoid turning up the thermostat at bedtime, as resting body temperatures require less heat and you will relax better in a room that is dark, cool and comfortable.

It's suggested that you ""<a href=""http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/let-sleep-work-you"">let sleep work for you</a>"" rather than fight against the perpetual time clock we are all born with. Turn to the restorative power of sleep when you experience fatigue and don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to others if a power nap is on the horizon or becomes part of your regular routine - <em>just do it</em>!  However, ensure that it really is just a power nap. Afternoon naps that consistently exceed much beyond an hour may indicate the lack of proper rest at night, or perhaps chronic sleep apnea. Check with your physician if long naps become a main component in your regular sleep cycle.

Before closing I must confess I've <em>always</em> suffered from insomnia so I recently tried a new breathing trick I heard about from <a href=""http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART00521/three-breathing-exercises.html"">Dr. Andrew Weil</a>.  I'm happy to report it seems to be working for me!  It's called the ""4-7-8"" or Relaxing Breathe Exercise.  Here's how you do it:
<ul style=""list-style-type: square;"">
	<li>Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound.</li>
	<li>Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of <strong>four</strong>.</li>
	<li>Hold your breath for a count of <strong>seven</strong>.</li>
	<li>Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound to a count of <strong>eight</strong>.</li>
	<li>This is one breath. Now inhale again and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths.</li>
</ul>
Sweet dreams should be a regular part of your sleep cycle. Practice silent <a href=""http://mrsmindfulness.com/mindfulness-as-a-cure-for-insomnia-8-steps-to-resting-easy/"">mindfulness</a> prior to shutting down your mind for the night - they say if you focus on something pleasant instead of counting sheep your dreams just might come true!",,"2020-10-15 17:31:03",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/sleepy/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/o-SLEEP-facebook.jpg,o-SLEEP-facebook,,"USA, New Jersey, Jersey City, Senior woman sitting in bed and suffering from insomnia",,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/o-SLEEP-facebook.jpg,,Longevity,,,4,86,,,,,,2928,,,,,,,1223,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",-,2015-10-15|2018-10-15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",sleepy,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:38:26",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1225,"Q&A:  Marketing to the 50+ w/ Dr. Alexis","<strong><i>Leading industry expert Dr. Alexis Abramson shares information and advice for marketers setting out to target the older-adult market or improve the success of their efforts…..</i></strong>

<i></i><i>by Colin Milner, Chief Executive Officer of the International Council on Aging</i><strong><em>®</em></strong>

When 2014 comes to a close, the Baby Boomers—that society-shaping generation born between 1946 and 1964<sup>1</sup>—will all belong to the 50-and-older age group. Leading-edge Boomers will start turning 70 just a year later. This generation of consumers has joined with today’s longer-living older generations to create a demographic representing a wealth of business opportunities for all kinds of companies.

For marketers, a traditionally youth-oriented profession, the 50+ demographic presents challenges as well. Too few marketers fully understand the new landscape. Research by Euromonitor, for example, projects the spending power of adults ages 60 and older to hit US$15 trillion by 2020, an increase of US$7 trillion over 2010 estimates.<sup>2</sup> Yet many marketers do not respond to older consumers or pay them little attention. According to a 2012 Nielsen report,<sup>3</sup> fully 95% of marketing dollars still target the 35-and-under consumer.

Unfortunately, those marketers who do attempt to reach and influence older consumers all too often fail. The 2014 Nielsen Global Survey About Aging revealed that more than half of the 30,000 individuals who responded to this poll “[did] not see advertising that reflects older consumers.”<sup>4</sup> These findings reinforce the fact that a great many marketing professionals need to learn more about the 50+ demographic and how to craft authentic portrayals of and effective messages for these consumers.

To help meet this need for education, the International Council on Active Aging® held a one-day symposium called “Marketing: moving beyond the status quo” in conjunction with its 2014 national conference in November. Among those anchoring the symposium was keynote speaker and panel moderator Dr. Alexis Abramson.

In her keynote, Abramson discussed how to capture the older-adult, or mature, market through Gerontographics. This segmentation approach, she explained, is based on the premise that the factors that make these consumers more (or less) receptive to marketing offerings are directly related to their needs and lifestyles, which are in turn influenced by changing life conditions.

A leading industry expert on those over age 50, Abramson<b> </b>has a PhD in gerontology from the University of Southern California’s Davis School of Gerontology. She is a speaker, blogger, corporate consultant, successful author, and award-winning entrepreneur and journalist. Her commitment to Boomers and older adults has been featured in many publications, including <i>TIME, Forbes, Entrepreneur</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i> The Emmy and Gracie award-winning journalist appears frequently as an on-air expert gerontologist for NBC’s <i>Today</i> show, CNN, CBS, MSNBC and other media outlets. Abramson is also a featured blogger on websites such as YAHOO!, Huffington Post, Sharecare and Caregiving.com. Her next book, <i>The Ultimate Longevity Guide,</i> will delve into the secrets for a happy, healthy (long) life.

“I am focused on the cutting-edge business and lifestyle trends that influence the 109 million Americans over the age of 50,”<sup>4</sup> Abramson says. “Older people are more active and vibrant than ever before, they’re projected to hold 70% of US disposable income in the next five years,<sup>3</sup> and they currently spend upwards of US$3 trillion every year on consumer-related services.<sup>2</sup> My job is to teach companies how to attract, and retain, those consumers.” Clients have included such major organizations as AARP, Arthritis Foundation, Philips Electronics, AIG, Comcast, Humana, Delta Airlines, American Automobile Association (AAA), Century 21, Kimberly Clark, Walmart and Hyatt.

In our recent interview for the <i>Journal on Active Aging®,</i> Dr. Abramson shared her thoughts with me about how the field of aging has changed, how businesses and marketing professionals are responding to the mature market, what advice she would offer new marketing professionals about older consumers, and what trends and traits are important to organizations that aim to target this market. Check out the discussion below for highlights.

<strong>CM: <i>Why did you choose the field of aging? And how has it changed since you first started?</i></strong><b></b>

<b>AA:</b> I chose the field of aging early on because I have always felt a kindred spirit towards the older generation. I spent a great deal of time with my grandparents when I was growing up and found my experiences with them to be life-changing. While others were putting the older generation out to pasture and marginalizing their role in our society, I was doing everything I could to learn from their experience and wisdom. I find my work extremely rewarding because, quite frankly, this is still an absolutely untapped market—the opportunities within the field are infinite. With the growing demographics and the true “global graying” on the way, those who have chosen to be in the field of aging are ripe for success, both from a personal and professional aspect.

The field of aging has changed dramatically since I first started out in the industry many moons ago. As our society continues to age, more and more people are entering the field on all levels—be it healthcare, technology, sales, etc. This influx of new blood into the field is positive. But there are also some real challenges associated with the overall growth.

Due to the fact that there are so many noble (and lucrative) opportunities, both from a business-to-business and business-to-consumer standpoint, we are attracting a ton of candidates that lack the experience and education needed to succeed. I’m of the opinion that we need to put some tighter parameters around the field, so that we have high standards and can effectively regulate the sector in an effort to deter unqualified individuals who simply want to make a quick buck.

<strong>CM: <i>Are companies responding to the needs, dreams, desires and wants of this market?</i></strong>

<b>AA:</b> It has taken a <i>long</i> time to get organizations to realize that the “silver tsunami” is truly upon us and that the 50+ generation <i>must</i> be paid attention to by governments, private companies, nonprofit organizations, and others. I’ve screamed from the rooftops about the impact of this tremendous demographic paradigm shift and tried to get people to let go of the myths associated with aging and fully embrace their own futures. So many companies just want to put this whole segment of society on the back burner. I’ve worked for decades to get businesses and individuals to understand—if for no other reason then the financial impact—that this is a viable segment that folks need to stop sidelining and start empowering.

Businesses, foundations and agencies in a wide variety of industries (including fashion, fitness, travel, healthcare, transportation, retail, automobile, relationship and real estate) need to be prepared to offer the services demanded by this growing population, which is already outspending other generations by an estimated US$400 billion each year on consumer goods and services.<sup>6</sup> So even while the escalating number of retired adults may begin to strain government resources, they will provide enormous money-making opportunities for those who are offering products and services that are geared toward 50+ individuals.

<strong>CM: <i>If I were just starting in the field of marketing, what advice would you offer me about the older consumer?</i></strong>

<b>AA:</b> My number one piece of advice is to never put the entire 50+ market into one bucket from a marketing standpoint—you must fully understand the various cohorts within this large sector. The 50+ are absolutely not a homogenous group, and they prefer not to be treated as one.

Whole generations of people who are retiring find themselves enjoying all kinds of adventurous activities that would have seemed atypical in the past. Older people are often active; they want to explore, learn new things, start new businesses, support new organizations. And even though they may not actually <i>do</i> all the things they <i>dream</i> about doing, they want to know the possibility is there and the products and services are available.

Members of the mature market are experiencing what I like to refer to as the 30 Bonus Years™. These are the additional “bonus” or “gifted” yearsthat we now have the luxury to enjoy as we grow older. Due mainly to technology and medical breakthroughs, the average life expectancy went from 47 in the 1900s to 77 and beyond today.<sup>7</sup> Now that we will be living much longer, the 50+ population is not willing to just step aside and be forgotten.

The key to working as a marketer in the field of aging is most definitely passion. But the nice thing is that due to the growing demand, you can turn your passion into profit—if you just know how! In order to be successful, you need to take the time to really study the 50+ market. So many organizations and individuals have jumped on the “gerontology bandwagon” in the last few years without truly taking the time to get to know the 50+ market. That’s why there are so many “fits and starts” in the industry.

I studied the field of gerontology on a PhD level, so I am able to get a true sense—from both quantitative and qualitative standpoints—about how to translate current industry-related research into action and therefore disrupt dated perceptions about the mature market.

<strong>CM: <i>What successes were achieved by following your advice? Did these transform your marketing efforts, or the efforts of your clients?</i></strong>

<b>AA:</b> Over the years my consulting work has influenced the media, corporate and nonprofit industries to create positive change for businesses and consumers alike. Some of my wins include:
<ul style=""list-style-type: square;"">
	<li>serving as the consumer expert/spokesperson for the Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan initiative and helping to raise awareness about all of the benefits it offers</li>
	<li>strategizing with the Delta Airlines marketing and branding teams on the development of the Delta frequent flyer program for mature adults and consequently helping them produce a business plan and marketing/advertising collateral related to the program</li>
	<li>assisting in the development, launch, implementation and promotion of the Bank of Montreal enCircle® caregiving initiative</li>
	<li>working closely with the Subway® restaurant chains marketing team to create original concepts in an effort to help them appeal to and capture the Baby Boomer demographic</li>
	<li>helping the Arthritis Foundation staff create an “Arthritis-Friendly” product selection for their website</li>
</ul>
I’ve been fortunate throughout my career to align with organizations that are not only excited about the opportunities within this vast 50+ segment, but that also truly understand the need to fully capitalize initiatives that will lead to a substantial return on their investment.

<strong>CM: <i>What traits lead to an organization succeeding with the older consumer?</i></strong>

<b>AA:</b> The size and buying power of the Boomer and older-adult demographics are staggering, but for some reason many companies mistakenly underestimate today’s mature market. With 77% of the current wealth in the United States being controlled by older adults, this market is clearly a viable target.<sup>8</sup> If companies want to reach this demographic, they need to understand how and why these consumers buy and/or use specific services. Marketing to Boomers, and older adults, involves establishing a relationship, building trust, and providing opportunities for growth, learning and interaction.

Techniques in 50+ sales, marketing and advertising continue to evolve and change rapidly. Organizations must put their business intelligence to work here and ask: Are Boomers and older adults included as prospective customers in our vertical markets? Companies that ignore these generations do so at their own peril. These businesses must recognize that as Americans are aging, they are accumulating wealth, and their spending is growing at a pace that’s leaving younger generations far behind. Companies need to be prepared for a rough ride over the next 20 years if they have a service or product that might appeal to the 50+ consumer but don’t have a strategy for making their offering relevant to this group.

<strong>CM: <i>What three aging trends do those in the field of marketing need to know about?</i></strong><b></b>

<b>AA: </b> Only three????  Ok….here goes….

<strong><i>Longevity:</i></strong> Older people comprise approximately 13% of the American population today.<sup>9</sup> But by the middle of the new century, more than 20% of the population will be over 65, and 5% will be over 85.<sup>9</sup> Beyond the extension of the human life span, and the likelihood of relatively good health during the later decades of life, there is another important demographic phenomenon: the so-called “bonus years.” Not only are we gaining years at the end of our lives, but we are also gaining healthy, productive years in our sixth, seventh or eighth decades. Unfortunately, we do not yet have blueprints or expectations for how these years might be spent. The new “bonus years” challenge us all—as policy-makers, professionals and individuals—to reconsider learning, work, self-expression and service, and to try out new paths for growth in the later years.

<strong><i>Aging in place:</i></strong> Tomorrow’s mature population will differ from those of past decades. They will enjoy longer lives, better health and more active lifestyles than previous generations. Still, the overwhelming majority will also face that growing and continuous challenge: maintaining their precious independence.  According to AARP, 9 out of 10 older adults stay where they currently live upon retirement, preferring to grow old in their own homes.<sup>10</sup> But successful “aging in place” demands that one’s home and household products provide continued enjoyment and stimulation, as well as support declining function and enhance quality of life. Refusing to be stigmatized by living in a “home for the aged” or using “elderly products,” aging Boomers will seek out designs that accommodate rather than discriminate, sympathize rather than stigmatize, and appeal to users of all ages and abilities.

<strong><i>Financial:</i></strong> The fact that people are now living longer is desirable and has improved individual welfare. However, there are financial costs of longer life expectancy—for governments through employee retirement plans and social security schemes, for corporate employers with defined-benefit pension plans, for insurers that sell annuities, and for individuals without guaranteed retirement benefits. The financial implications of people living longer than expected (the so-called “longevity risk”) are large. Things will get more expensive. Even if inflation averages about 3% per year, the cost of living will double in just 23 years.<sup>11</sup>

</ul>
<strong>CM: <i>What’s next for Alexis Abramson?</i></strong>

<b>AA:</b> At the moment, I’m immersed in delivering keynote speeches, serving as a spokesperson for products and services geared to the 50+ consumer, and consulting with corporate clients as they create plans to properly position themselves to embrace the 50+ market segment.

I’m helping my clients understand the significant impact that longevity will have on their businesses (and their bottom line). Consumers now have this whole new “segment” of their lives to figure out what to do with and how to plan for going forward. Most of us will be experiencing many different transitions, good and bad, during this time period—widowhood, second careers, going back to school, new relationships, following our passions, reinventing ourselves, grandparenting, divorce, new hobbies, spirituality, chronic conditions, recovery, second families, and more. Basically we will recognize a “new life stage.” Instead of the traditional bell curve (young, middle age, old age), we will have childhood, adulthood, new life stage (a.k.a. “30 Bonus Years”), retirement, and old age.

I’m determined to help organizations reach and capture these “longevity” customers. To explore and answer questions such as: What kinds of products and services need to be developed to facilitate these additional years? What does research tell us will allow us to live as healthy, happy, wealthy and wise as possible during this new life stage? What are the cutting-edge 50+ business and lifestyle trends? And how do we effectively market and position products and services with the bonus years in mind?

<b>Responding to the market</b>

For marketers that aim to enter the mature market or to improve on current efforts, questions abound about how to reach and appeal effectively to age 50+ consumers. How do these professionals create messages that resonate with this market? Success comes with becoming more knowledgeable about older adults; understanding the incredible diversity of this market and the needs, dreams, desires, hopes, abilities and expectations of consumers; crafting messages that speak to these realities; and reflecting authentic portrayals of this life stage.

Questions about marketing go hand-in-hand with larger questions about how companies respond to the age 50+ demographic, as Dr. Abramson suggests. Immense opportunities await those that recognize the mature market constitutes not just a viable, but also a desirable, target—one with more disposable income,<sup>3</sup> net worth<sup>12</sup> and spending power<sup>3</sup> than younger generations. This market also reflects every facet of the wide-ranging and changing experiences of aging today. Companies that make these consumers a priority will reap the benefits for decades to come.

1251,"How old is your skin?  Take the pinch test.","Unfortunately there's NO debating the fact that as we age our skin loses its elasticity, becomes wrinkled and for some quite leathery (<em>hello sun goddesses!</em>).  According to the powers that be ""this is the result of free-radical destruction and is a sign of degeneration and loss of function"" - or more simply <strong>AGING</strong>!

It's well noted that a significant change in the skin becomes evident at about the age of 45 - since I've passed that magical milestone I thought it might be time to take a ""<em>skin elasticity test</em>"" to see how my <em>skin age</em> rates compared to my <em>actual age</em>.  My amazing brother, <a href=""http://www.facialplasticsatlanta.com/about-us/dr-peter-abramson.php"">Dr. Peter Abramson</a>, is a phenomenal plastic surgeon - <em>and person</em> - so I was thinking if all else failed and my skin turned out to have the elasticity age of a 90 year old he was my plan B (<em>I know shameless plug for Dr. Pete!</em>).

It's super easy to take the skin elasticity test – just pinch the skin on the back of your hand with your thumb and forefinger and hold it for five seconds. Let go and time how long it takes for the skin to flatten back out. The shorter the time, the younger the 'functional age' of the skin.

In case my instructions are confusing here's a video of the test I did - I'm thinking my elasticity was a little under 3 seconds so my skin is (<em>apparently</em>) younger than my chronological age - <strong>YEAH</strong>!

[embed]https://vimeo.com/121485265[/embed]

So please <em>share</em> - how did you <em>fare</em> in the skin test?  Is your skin elasticity older or younger than your true age or were you right on target?

<em>You can compare your results to the table chart below:</em>

<strong>Time</strong> (<em>Seconds</em>)         <strong>Functional age</strong> (<em>Years</em>)

<strong>1-2                                under 30</strong>
<strong> 3-4                                30-44</strong>
<strong> 5-9                                45-50</strong>
<strong> 10-15                            60</strong>
<strong> 35-55                           70</strong>
<strong> 56 or more                over 70</strong>

If you’ve noticed your skin elasticity isn’t what it used to be, (<em>and this test confirmed that observation</em>), you can make some small changes and you'll see a significant difference.

For starters, decrease your sugar intake - try to keep your sweets to a minimum at definitely no more than 10 percent of your total calories.  Also, avoid high fructose corn syrup and be careful how many pieces of yummy fruit you eat each day (<em>I limit my intake to two pieces a day</em>).

Make sure you always wear sunscreen, especially on your face, neck, arms and upper chest (<em>ok just put it everywhere!</em>), as skin elasticity is lost more quickly when left unprotected and overexposed to the sun.  Many daily moisturizers now contain SPF so if you use this type of lotion you don't even have to take the extra step of lathering on SPF.

Also, in order to maintain your skin’s elasticity, avoid harmful and damaging lifestyle choices like smoking, drugs, excessive alcohol consumption and using products that are harmful to your skin.  If you’re feeling super stressed try some relaxation techniques to lessen these feelings.  Why not try the practice of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness"">mindfulness</a> - if for no other reason than for the sake of your health, beauty, happiness and longevity.

Sleep is also a big one when it comes to looking and feeling your best - as someone who suffers from chronic insomnia I can tell you a good night's sleep takes a decade off when it comes to your appearance (<em>ok at least a year or so!</em>).  Here's a link to a Huffington Post blog I recently wrote about all that insomnia stuff….<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexis-abramson-phd/are-you-sleepy-all-the-time-dont-panic_b_6612090.html"">SLEEP</a>!!!!

In addition, what we eat really does have a HUGE impact on our skin and the beautiful bright and shiny glow we all want (<em>and love</em>)!  It’s no secret that eating healthy foods can help ward off disease, keep you feeling good on a daily basis and provide a healthy-looking appearance.

<em>Antioxidants</em> is a word that pops up constantly when talking about skin elasticity and anti-aging - these compounds are said to be the ""weapon against cell-damaging free radicals that can lead to premature aging"" - who knew?  Eating healthy foods like cranberries, walnuts, red peppers and red grapes can help save skin elasticity and maintain suppleness and youth.  Antioxidants can speed up the cell replacement process and neutralize the harmful free radicals in your body.

Here are some other healthy foods that are both easy to incorporate into your day and they're good for you!

<strong>Leafy greens:</strong> Folate, calcium and other nutrients are good for bone density and they help keep cognitive functions strong.
<strong>Berries:</strong> Blueberries, raspberries and cranberries are packed with antioxidants, which can help ward off disease.
<strong>Tomatoes:</strong> They contain lycopene, an antioxidant compound that research indicates will reduce cancer risks and heart disease.
<strong>Nuts:</strong> Almonds and walnuts are filling and offer healthy fats, vitamins and protein. It’s an easy snack for when you are on the go.
<strong>Red wine:</strong> In moderation, red wine is a healthy pleasure. It contains resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant. That being said...it takes a great deal of daily red wine to benefit....
<strong>Wild salmon:</strong> Omega 3s are plentiful in this delicious fish. Research suggests that this these fatty acids can lower your risk for Alzheimer’s and stroke.
<strong>Green tea:</strong> Another great way to get antioxidants. Go for the higher end loose leaf teas, which pack a rich flavor that may even replace your coffee habit.
<strong>Beans:</strong> High in fiber, protein and antioxidants, beans aren’t just good for the waistline, they may aid in disease prevention.
<strong>Carrots:</strong> Of course they are good for your eyes, but don’t forget – they’re also good for your hair and scalp, thanks to Vitamin A.
<strong>Eggs:</strong> Full of biotin and iron, which give that healthy glow in your skin and hair.
<strong>Water: </strong>Drinking an adequate amount of water daily is important for overall good health because water aids in digestion, circulation, absorption and even excretion.

Famous comedian George Burns was once quoted as saying, “If you live to be one hundred, you’ve got it made. Very few people die past that age”. By 2050, it is estimated that there will be more than one million centenarians living in the u.S.1 For most people, planning for retirement or their later years is focused mostly on finances and how they will spend their time. However, ensuring they spend those years in good health is something that many overlook. The times are certainly changing, with medical advances and technological breakthroughs, planning for retirement and living longer needs to be more holistic.

I recently had the opportunity to conduct a large sample survey (<em>in Canada and the US</em>) and report the fascinating findings in a comprehensive white paper entitled the ""<a href=""https://www.bmo.com/privatebank/pdf/Q3_2014_Wealth_Institute_Report.pdf"">Four Keys to Longevity</a>.""  The compelling findings of the BMO Wealth Institute survey speak to the need for all of us to have a better overall plan when it comes to the four key components of longevity; body, mind, social and financial. Many challenges that may arise in our later years can be both anticipated, and properly planned for, by making smart decisions focused on the ultimate goal of successful longevity.

Below is an infographic with some of our most interesting findings - just click to enlarge.

1308,"Compromise When You're A Caregiver","Does it ever seem like you and your parent’s can’t agree on anything?  Is your aging loved one extremely critical?  Does your mother try to make you feel guilty when you don’t do everything her way?  Does your father clearly favor one of your siblings over you, when you're the one that takes care of him every day?

If you answered yes to any - or perhaps all - of these questions, you’re not alone.  I can’t count the number of people who have told me that their relationship with their aging parent is fraught with conflict and hurt feelings.  And no wonder.  We all have issues from our childhood, personality conflicts and unresolved problems.  Why should it be any different for you and your parents now that you’re older?

In fact, there is good reason to expect <em>more </em>conflict between you and your aging parent as you become a caregiver.  The average family caregiver spends eighteen hours a week tending to a parent or older adult.  In the most severe cases, when the person being cared for lives in your home and has dementia, that figure increases to about eighty-seven hours of caregiving a week.  That’s a lot of togetherness, even in ideal circumstances!  Normally the situations under which we assume the caregiving role are far from optimal.  The role changes that occur when you assume responsibility for your parent are difficult for all involved.  For parents, accepting the losses and limitations of aging and facing their own mortality isn’t easy.  For children, it can be both upsetting and frightening to see the people who once took care of them, unable to care for themselves.  When a parent and child, each having to deal with their own issues, are forced into the new roles neither asked for, the setting is ripe for conflict.  Furthermore, few of us enter the caregiving role free of hurt feelings or areas of disagreement.  There is at least some friction in virtually all parent-child relationships almost from the time we are born.  When you were a toddler and threw a tantrum because your father wouldn’t buy you candy, that was conflict.  When you were fifteen and your mother wouldn’t let you date, even though all of your friends were doing it, that was conflict.  Now that you’ve grown up, you may think that all of the “issues” have been resolved – and many of them probably have.  But whether you are aware of it or not, there are still likely to be some areas of unresolved differences, even as new differences and conflicts arise.

It has often been said that whatever personality traits people have when they are young will only be magnified when they get older.  A woman who’s fastidious about her housekeeping when she’s young, for example, may become more so as she ages.  A man who has a short fuse when his children are little may be even quicker to anger when they are grown.  The same holds true of relationships as we age.  Problems that are present in relationships when we are young don’t just go away because we have grown up.  In fact, unless we work to resolve them, they only become magnified and cause more trouble throughout the years.  In addition, the stresses of growing old and the losses that accompany old age and illness can cause unexpected changes in your loved ones personality.  An otherwise mild-mannered parent may start to snap at you or criticize you.  A parent who appreciated your every gesture of kindness several years ago may now respond angrily instead of gratefully when you try to help.  A father who once seemed unflustered by just about anything may become quick tempered and frustrated when his checkbook doesn’t balance or he can’t climb the steps like he used to.  Caregivers personalities can change unexpectedly too.  When plagued by an overwhelming sense of duty, lack of sleep and sheer exhaustion, even the most patient and loving caregiver can find herself behaving in ways she never imagined.  Despite all that may be going against a harmonious relationship, you must try to resolve conflicts so that your aging family members get what is truly needed and your final years, months, or days together aren’t full of fighting and hurt feelings.  Dealing with an aging parent, as with anyone, requires give and take.  Sometimes you both have to compromise.

1309,"Caring for Someone with Alzheimer’s","Approximately 10 million individuals are caring for a person with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) or another dementia. Although memory loss is the most common symptom, others include confusion, lack of orientation and changes in personality and behavior. Individuals with AD require escalating levels of care, management and provisions for their safety. Because the disease slowly gets worse, caregivers often spend a long time in the caregiving role.

As a matter of fact a recent survey found that 25 percent of those caring for someone with Alzheimer’s provide 40 hours of weekly care with about 75 percent performing physically demanding kinds of personal care that include bathing, feeding and bathroom assistance.  Understandably, 40 percent of these caregivers reported high levels of emotional stress, particularly those who are working full or part-time; last year two-thirds of working caregivers missed work because of caregiving responsibilities and 8% turned down promotions.  It has been estimated that unpaid Alzhimer’s Disease caregivers provide an economic asset to our society worth almost $83 billion.

To support these caregivers, the Alzheimer’s Research Foundation offers caregivers assistance through education, services, research and advocacy programs; such programs are at local, state and national levels. There is also funding available to assist family caregivers under the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP).  The Alzheimer's Foundation of America offers these tips for success as you give the best care possible for a loved one with Alzheimers.

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Caregiving Tips: Strategies for Success</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Educate yourself about the disease.</strong> Read books, attend workshops and consult with healthcare professionals.</li>
	<li><strong>Learn caregiving techniques.</strong> Key areas are communication skills, safety concerns, and managing behavioral challenges and activities of daily living.</li>
	<li><strong>Understand the experience of your loved one.</strong> Adjust your expectations. Be patient and kind.</li>
	<li><strong>Avoid caregiver burnout.</strong> Make time for yourself. Join caregiver support groups. Pursue interests beyond your caregiving role, such as exercise, hobbies, journaling and art.</li>
	<li><strong>Maintain your own physical and mental health.</strong> Exercise, respite and other activities can reduce stress. Seek medical help if there are signs of depression.</li>
	<li><strong>Discuss the situation with family and friends.</strong> Support systems are critical.</li>
	<li><strong>Do cognitive stimulation activities with your loved one.</strong> Listening to music, word puzzles and memory games can easily be done at home.</li>
	<li> <strong>Foster communication with physicians.</strong> Be involved in your loved one's medical care. Ask questions about the progression of the disease, express concerns and discuss treatment options.</li>
	<li> <strong>Take care of financial, legal and long-term care planning issues.</strong> Try to involve your loved one in decision-making, if they are still capable of providing input, and consider their wishes related to future care and end-of-life issues.</li>
	<li> <strong>Smile.</strong> Kindness, humor and creativity are essential parts of caregiving. Hugs, hand massage and other gentle physical contact will help your loved one feel connected and loved.</li>
	<li> <strong>Think positively.</strong> Focus on your loved one's remaining strengths and enjoy your relationship while you are still able to.</li>

<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center""> To create a master calendar, find a template of a calendar online with plenty of room for writing.  Go through the whole year, filling in any dates when you know you or your family members will be called on to help – for example, your Moms long standing appointment with her dentist or her weekly appointment with the physical therapist or the hairdresser.  Also, make a note of specific times that you plan or need to be off.  If you don’t have plans to be off, make some.  Pick a week or two during the year and mark that time on the calendar - you’re going to need a break!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center"">As various family members commit to handling specific caregiving duties, add their names to the calendar next to the time and task.  Then, each month, email a copy of the next month’s calendar to all of the involved family members.  Along with the month’s calendar, include an overview of the month’s ahead: your vacation next June during which your sister will be filling in for you for a week; your mother’s college reunion in August, which your brother promised to take her to; and your parent’s Thanksgiving trip, for which your Aunt promised to purchase airline tickets and arrange transportation to and from the airport.</p>

1311,"Caregivers It's Time to Honor Yourself!","<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center"">As caregivers we must honor ourselves, something that we at times neglect to do.  After all, from our earliest memories, we have always been told to honor our mother and father.  Unfortunately, many of us believe that honoring our mother and father somehow means neglecting our own wants and needs.  But is that what our parents really want for us?  Is caregiving to the point of exhaustion and despair really honoring your parents?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center"">By honoring your own needs, you’re not only achieving your parents’ goal for your life (most parents want what’s best for their children, don’t they?), but you’re also keeping yourself healthy and sane so that you can take care of them as time progresses.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center"">If you have children of your own, remember that your behavior toward your parents now will be a model for how your kids will act toward you someday if they’re confronted with the same situation.  Wouldn’t you want your children to help you out of love - but still take time to nourish their own lives - rather than serving you hand and foot with anger and resentment building all the way?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center"">For most parents, the goal of raising children is to make them self-sufficient to pursue their own goals and dreams - not to be slaves to caring for their parents.  Thinking of your children, or nieces and nephews if you don’t have your own kids, can help you focus on the role you should play in your own parents’ care.</p>

1312,"Great Tips for First Time Caregivers","It’s quite likely that at one point or another we will all be faced with what is often referred to as the “<em>impossible profession”</em> - caregiving.  Currently there are over 44 million caregivers in the United States -- nearly one in four U.S. households is involved in caring for a relative or friend aged 50 or older. The average age of a caregiver is 57.  Caregiving is largely a women's issue. Some 72 percent of caregivers are female, mostly wives and adult daughters. More than one in three, however, are mature adults themselves (65 years of age and older).

Caregiving can last from less than a year to over forty years. 80 percent of caregivers provide at least some type of unpaid assistance seven days a week. By 2030 one in five Americans will be at least 65, for a total of about 70 million older people, more than twice the number than in 1996.  Over 100 million people in the U.S. have one or more chronic condition and over the next twenty-five years this number is expected to increase to 134 million Americans.

Here are some important online caregiver resources for you to consult when you are feeling you need caregiving support, respite or simply someone to talk to!

Caring for an aging loved one is one of the hardest jobs you will ever have.  There will most likely be times when you’ll feel that you just can’t go on – times when it seems you and your family can’t agree on anything; times when no one, including your parent, appreciates what you’re doing, yet everyone makes you feel <em>invisible</em>; times when you feel you just can’t pick up another prescription, schedule another appointment, lose another night’s sleep or see your parent slip further away from the strong, competent adult who once cared for and protected you.  Yes, there will be times when every day, indeed every hour, feels like a struggle for survival.

It’s times like those that you must reach out for help.  You <em>must</em>.  Though it may seem hard to believe at this point in your life, your caregiving duties won’t go on forever.  When your days as a caregiver have ended, you’ll want to look back and know you did the best you could for your parent with all of the resources available to you.  You’ll want to know you made the most of the last days, months and years with your loved one – surviving the bad times but always remembering to seek out and cherish the good.  Just as important, you will want to have a life to return to – filled with people you love, activities that interest you, and the good health to enjoy them.  Your aging loved one would want nothing less for you!

1313,"Learning How to Caregive Effectively for a Spouse","More than 50 million people across the country currently provide an estimated $306 billion in ""free"" caregiving services for a chronically ill, disabled or aged spouse, family member or friend during any given year. That is almost twice as much as is actually spent on homecare and nursing home services combined ($158 billion).  According to the <a href=""http://www.caregiving.org/"">Family Caregiving Alliance</a>, there is a much higher likelihood of receiving care from a spouse than from an adult child.  In fact, nearly one-quarter, 22 percent, of caregivers who are currently caring for a spouse are themselves over the age of 65.

Caregivers often are so busy caring for others that they tend to neglect their own emotional, physical, and spiritual health. The demands on a caregiver's body, mind, and emotions can easily seem overwhelming, leading to fatigue and hopelessness -- and, ultimately, burnout.  Spousal caregivers are especially prone to “burnout” because the significant changes in the marital relationship can often leave the spouse who is giving the care feeling overwhelmed and stressed. This anxiety can be compounded if the caregiver is also taking over responsibilities that were once handled solely by their ailing spouse, from cooking and doing laundry, to balancing the checkbook and heading up the financial decisions.

In addition, there is very often a considerable sense of loss when one is involved in caring for their spouse. This is especially prevalent if ones spouse suffers from significant cognitive decline or if activities that once provided pleasure and deepened a sense of connection are no longer possible. Caregiving spouses often begin to feel very isolated from friends and feel tremendous guilt about their own unmet needs. Subsequently, they take on this ""labor of love"" and let their own positive health habits drop off to the side, putting their health at risk.

In fact, the <em>Journal of American Medical Association</em> reports that if one is a spousal caregiver between the ages of 66 and 96, and is experiencing ongoing mental or emotional strain as a result of their caregiving duties, there is a 63 percent increased risk of dying over those people in the same age group who are not caring for a spouse. The combination of loss, prolonged stress, the physical demands of caregiving and the health vulnerabilities that simply come with age place an older spousal caregiver in a danger zone.

Spousal caregivers especially need to know and recognize the symptoms of burnout and how best to cope. It is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion that may be accompanied by a change in attitude -- from positive and caring to negative and unconcerned. Burnout can occur when spousal caregivers don't get the help they need or if they try to do more than they are able -- either physically or financially.  Here are some tips to help identify and address someone who is experiencing spousal caregiver burnout.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mEmKluc_P1o?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<strong>Q: What are some of the signs that a spousal caregiver is experiencing burnout?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Missing or delaying their own doctor appointments</li>
 	<li>Ignoring their own health problems or symptoms</li>
 	<li>Not eating a healthy diet for lack of time</li>
 	<li>Overusing tobacco and alcohol when they feel stressed</li>
 	<li>Giving up exercise habits for lack of time</li>
 	<li>Losing sleep</li>
 	<li>Losing connections with friends for lack of time to socialize</li>
 	<li>Bottling up feelings of anger and frustration and then being surprised by angry, even violent, outbursts directed at your spouse, other family members, co-workers - even strangers</li>
 	<li>Feeling sad, down, depressed or hopeless</li>
 	<li>Loss of energy</li>
 	<li>Lacking interest in things that used to give them (and their spouse) pleasure</li>
 	<li>Feeling resentful toward their spouse</li>
 	<li>Blaming their spouse for the situation</li>
 	<li>Feeling that people ask more of them than they should</li>
 	<li>Feeling like caregiving has affected family relationships in a negative way</li>
 	<li>Feeling annoyed by other family members who don't help out or who criticize their level of care</li>
</ul>
<strong>Q: What are some of the long-term effects of spousal caregiver burn out?</strong>

Stress of spousal caregiving for persons with dementia has been shown to impact a person’s immune system for up to three years after their caregiving ends thus increasing their chances of developing a chronic illness themselves. Also, spousal caregivers experiencing extreme stress have been shown to age prematurely. This level of stress can take as much as 10 years off a spousal caregiver's life.

<strong>Q: What is the best way to prevent burnout?</strong>

Here are ten great tips that were provided by the Family Caregivers Association….
<ul>
 	<li>Caregiving is a job and respite is your earned right. Reward yourself with respite breaks often.</li>
 	<li>Watch out for signs of depression and don’t delay in getting professional help when you need it.</li>
 	<li>When people offer to help to help, accept the offer and suggest specific things that they can do to help.</li>
 	<li>Educate yourself about your loved one’s condition and how to communicate effectively with doctors.</li>
 	<li>There’s a difference between caring and doing. Be open to technologies and ideas that promote your loved one’s independence.</li>
 	<li>Trust your instincts. Most of the time they’ll lead you in the right direction.</li>
 	<li>Caregivers often do a lot of lifting, pushing, and pulling. Be good to your back.</li>
 	<li>Grieve for your loss and then allow yourself to dream new dreams.</li>
 	<li>Seek support from other caregivers. There is great strength in knowing you are not alone.</li>
 	<li>Stand up for your rights as a caregiver and a citizen.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Q: Why do some spousal caregivers have a hard time asking for help?</strong>

Because they feel that asking for help is a sign they aren't handling the situation well. But the truth is…your spouse/partner will be in better hands if you, yourself have some help. It is important to have people to support you, while taking care of someone else.

<strong>Q: What are some preparations that a spousal caregiver can make to help ease the pressure?</strong>

Get papers and affairs out of the way: This seems to be a common-sense type of thing but it is one that is often put off until it is too late. If the spouse has Alzheimer’s disease and can no longer sign for him/herself matters are dramatically more complex. It is important not to just get a will made and signed, but to take care of all the other paper work. Mortgages and all debts should be caught up. You should consult with an experienced elder lawyer about the disposition of assets while your spouse is still considered legally competent. Make sure that you have other legal documents such as durable Powers of Attorney filled out for both you and your spouse. Without a durable POA you may have to go get a guardianship later in order to speak for your spouse and protect your spouse’s rights.

<strong>Q: What are some of the more positive aspects of being a spousal caregiver?</strong>

While caregiving can be a very stressful situation for many spousal caregivers, studies also show that there are beneficial effects, including feeling positive about being able to help a disabled spouse, feeling appreciated by the care recipient, and feeling that their relationship with the care recipient had improved.

1314,"Moving?  Now is the Time to Downsize Your Home","For many seniors, and their caregivers, having to move out of<em> </em>their home can be an extremely traumatic experience.  For people who have lived in the same home for a long time, especially if they raised their children there, selling their family home may be particularly difficult.  But for some, a move to an apartment, senior community or assisted-living center promises a welcome new way of life - one free of climbing steps, mowing lawns, raking leaves, repairing fences, shoveling snow and cleaning gutters (or, in the case of the latter, having to hire and pay someone to do those things).  In those situations, the adult children may be more upset by the move than the parents.

If your parents are initiating a move and you’re saddened, try to understand it’s probably in their best interest.  If they want or need help, offer to assist in getting their home ready to sell, selecting new living arrangements, finding the best financing and moving their possessions.  If it helps you, spend time reminiscing with them about their home and all that happened there - especially if it’s the home where your grew up.  Ask if you can select some special items that will remind you of the house – perhaps a picture that used to hang on your bedroom wall or a pretty vase that always held cut flowers on your mother’s dining room table.  If you have the space in your home, maybe you would prefer larger items such as the dining room table itself!  Also, be sure your aging loved ones locate <em>and </em>keep items that are important to them to help their new living space feel not only comfortable but maintain familiarity.

If it’s your aging loved ones who are resisting the move, play up the positives of leaving a home they may no longer be able to manage.  If they are moving from their own home to an apartment, many of the hassles of home ownership - clogged gutters, leaky faucets, burst pipes, rotten floor boards and broken air conditioners – become the responsibilities of their landlord.  With fewer hassles, they’ll have more time to do the things they enjoy.

Also, help your parents find new living arrangements that will suit them.  Though finances and their level of independence may limit the options, you probably have more choices than you realize.  Remember, always be creative!  One woman told me that when her parents became unable to properly care for the two-story home where she grew up, neither she nor they felt they could be happy anywhere else.  After looking at more than a dozen senior communities, she and her husband came up with a plan.  They moved into the house themselves and had the basement finished into a walk-in level apartment for her parents.  “It turned out to be the perfect solution,” she said.  “my parents didn’t have to sell the house, they sill have their own space and I’m close by in case they need me.”

1315,"How to Plan a Family Caregiving Meeting","If your family is like most, you don’t all live in the same city – or maybe not even within a day’s drive of one another!  You’re here and there, with jobs, families and responsibilities.  Regardless of your whereabouts many of the decisions and tasks of caring for an elderly parent must sometimes be handled as a <em>family</em>.  A good way to do that is with a family meeting.

The time to plan a family meeting is<em> before</em> your parent(s) has a crisis that requires immediate attention.  Be proactive.  Clues from your parent – such as increasing forgetfulness, missed medications or difficulties managing money, keeping house or getting to appointments – are all signs that a family meeting may be in order.  The following ten tips will help make your family meeting more efficient and productive.

<strong>Meet ASAP.</strong>  If a crisis has happened and you’re the primary caregiver, the sooner you hold the meeting, the sooner you can get help and the less time your family members have to get stuck in the comfortable rut of letting you do all the work.

<strong>Set the Agenda.</strong>  This meeting is serious business.  Make up an agenda just as you would if you were holding a business meeting.  Carefully consider which decisions need to be made and which tasks need to be completed.  Write them all down in advance.  If possible, mail, e-mail or fax a copy to all family members before meeting.  This will give them ample time to consider how they can best help before they meet with the entire group.

<strong>Establish Meeting Rules.  </strong>One person should lead the meeting.  Often, this is the person who is closest (either geographically and/or emotionally) to the parent and who will most likely be the primary caregiver.  In some cases, people have a family friend or less involved third party lead the meeting.  Make it clear that each person should treat the others with respect.  No shouting.  No interrupting.  No name-calling.  You get the idea.

<strong>Give Everyone Time to Talk.</strong>  Everyone should have the opportunity to provide input and have your full attention while they speak.  To ensure that even quiet family members get a chance to talk, give each one an allotted time.  You might want to call on them in alphabetical order or in order of age.

<strong>Ask for Volunteers.</strong>  Give everyone the opportunity to volunteer for particular tasks (such as locating legal documents, picking up your parent’s prescriptions, or hiring a home health care aide).  Before the meeting, decide whom you would choose for each job and make a list.  Consider your family members’ talents and interests – which jobs would they do well?  Which jobs would they most likely enjoy?  If no one volunteers for tasks, start recruiting based on your list.

<strong>Be Specific.  </strong>If you need help with certain caregiving tasks, be specific with your requests.  For example, “Mom gets a senior discount at the grocery store on Wednesdays.  Would one of you be able to take her to the grocery store each Wednesday morning?” or “I have to be out of town for business March 10 through 14.  Could one of you plan to check on her daily and be on call for her on those particular days?”

<strong>Focus on the Issue at Hand.</strong>  Your sister was rude to you last Thanksgiving.  Your brother’s rowdy kids practically wrecked your home.  Sure, you have grievances with your siblings, but now is not the time to bring them up or let them influence your decisions.  The family meeting is to discuss your parent’s – nothing more.  Stick to the task.

<strong>Look to the Future.</strong>  As you arrange your parent’s care for the here and now, don’t forget that health and abilities change – sometimes quickly.  Come up with a contingency plan – or at least the agreement to hold another family meeting if your parent’s condition changes and you need to make new arrangements or assign new responsibilities.

<strong>Establish a Spokesperson.</strong>  If your parent needs someone to communicate with his or her doctor and other health professionals, it’s much better to assign one person to the task.  Pick someone who is reliable, has good communication skills and is willing to keep other family members up to date regarding your parent’s health information.  Often this will be the primary caregiver, because this person has the main responsibility for their parent’s care and probably has the closest relationship with the medical team.

<strong>Request a break.</strong>  If family members live far from your parent and have difficulty participating in day-to-day care, request that they devote one week of their vacation time each year to give you a break.  If that’s not possible, at least ask for an occasional weekend.  Get them to commit to specific dates in writing.  Depending on your parent’s health, he or she may be able to travel to them or they may need to come to the parent.  The important thing is that you get time off to relax and rejuvenate away from your parent.

1316,"Ask ""Dr. Alexis"" - Questions & Answers","<strong>Q.  My 87 year old mother-in-law still lives in the house that she grew up in.  The house has very steep stairs, a small doorway and is not “senior-friendly.”  My husband and I want to help her move to a retirement community, but she’s scared – how can we ease the transition for her?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>Having just moved to a different home – I completely understand how she feels – moving is something that is very hard for all us and it can be especially difficult for someone who has lived in a particular neighborhood or house for a lifetime!  But fear not, because there are “senior relocation specialists” who focus on helping older adults move with ease.  They start with a pre-move consultation to help come up with a plan as to the best items to keep and those your aging loved one might consider leaving behind.  The specialist makes it a very positive experience for the individual involved and makes sure they bring all of their <em>sentimental</em> belongings to their new home.  The specialist then sets the older adult up in the new home and creates a look and feel as similar as possible to their previous home.  This helps make the individual “feel at home.”  Go online and google “senior relocation specialists” and you will find a specialist in your mother-in-laws area.

<strong>Q.  My Mom has gotten a bit forgetful lately.  I told her that she didn’t need to worry too much and that it was just a natural part of aging.  Am I right?</strong>

<strong>A. </strong>Age related changes in the brain can make it harder to learn and remember certain things. Memory problems that aren't usually considered to be a part of “normal aging” are: forgetting things much more often than you used to, having trouble learning new things, repeating phrases or stories in the same conversation and having trouble making routine choices or handling money. I would definitely suggest that you have your mother discuss her memory problems with her physician to make sure she is properly diagnosed.  One decision that everyone, especially mature adults, should stick to is the promise to keep our minds sharp <em>throughout </em>our lives.  Researchers call this lifelong process “cognitive vitality.”

<strong>Q.  My husband just retired and he seems incredibly bored!  Can you suggest something adventurous that we could do together outside of the regular “keep busy activities” that everyone always recommends?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>This is a very common question – believe me you’re not alone wondering what to do with your spouse after they’ve retired!  Why not try going on a volunteer vacation together?  “Voluntourism” is one of the fastest growing segments of the travel industry and it’s about seeing the world from a firsthand perspective rather than as a passive tourist looking through a window.  It’s very economical and it allows you to experience a country that you want to visit while working, eating and living with the local residents.  Not only do you get to travel and see the world, but you will also be making a difference.  You can find the top “volunteer vacations” online at websites like <a href=""http://www.globalvolunteers.org"">www.globalvolunteers.org</a> and <a href=""http://www.earthwatch.org"">www.earthwatch.org</a>.  Safe Travels!

<strong>Q.  My father unexpectedly passed away and he was in charge of all of my parent’s financial affairs.  Where do I begin in terms of helping my Mom with her taxes?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>My condolences to you and your family for the loss of your father.  Fortunately, one of the programs the IRS sponsors is Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE).  In conjunction with this program AARP offers its Tax-Aide counseling at more than 9,000 sites nationwide each filing season.  Trained and certified AARP Tax-Aide volunteer counselors help people of low-to-moderate incomes with special attention to those aged 60 and over.  For more information on TCE call 1-800-829-1040.  To locate the nearest AARP Tax-Aide site, call 1-888-227-7669 or visit <a href=""http://www.aarp.org"">www.aarp.org</a>.  The IRS also offers many publications for older Americans to help them understand their taxes.  You can learn more about this informatin on the web at <a href=""http://www.irs.gov"">www.irs.gov</a> or call 1-800-829-1040.

<strong>Q.  I’m 65 and I love to exercise but sometimes my arthritis gets the best of me! Can you recommend some low impact exercises that will help me stay fit?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>There is no doubt that joint-jarring activities like aerobics and kickboxing are giving way to gentler pursuits for people, like you, who have a chronic condition.  In your case I suggest you look into pilates, yoga, tai chi, elliptical trainers and exercise bikes.  Whatever you choose – keep exercising regularly!  With heart disease, cancer and strokes serving as the leading causes of death for mature adults, staying physically active not only helps to <em>prevent</em> many illnesses, it can <em>improve</em> the health of people who already have debilitating diseases or disabilities.  Just a reminder, make sure you check with your physician before you begin any new exercise routine.

<strong>Q.  My Dad has a really hard time sleeping – he says his joints and legs ache.  Can you recommend something I can do to help him sleep better?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>Changes in sleeping patterns are a normal part of aging.  As people age they tend to have a harder time falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep than when they were younger.  Fortunately there are several sleep aids that can help ease your Dads leg and muscle aches and provide more comfort to help him sleep.  One of these products is called the Butterfly Leg Massage Pillow – you can get one for him online at www.target.com.  This ergonomic pillow will put support where he needs it most so he can sleep better.  You can find much more information and tips for better sleeping by visiting <a href=""http://www.sleepfoundation.org"">www.sleepfoundation.org</a> or calling (202) 347-3471.

<strong>Q.  My daughter and her family are spending the holidays with her husband’s family this year.  I don’t want to be alone but I don’t them to feel guilty about not being with me either.  What should I do?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>It’s okay to let your daughter know you’re a bit apprehensive about being alone over the holidays and you would rather be around people during this time.  Perhaps you can join your daughter in visiting her in-laws so that the whole family can be together for the season!  You can also consider volunteering your time in your community during the holidays.  Giving to others is a great way to forget your own concerns and make a difference for someone who needs your help.  For more information about volunteering, visit: <a href=""http://www.volunteermatch.org"">www.volunteermatch.org</a> or call (415) 241-6872.

<strong>Q.  My Dad spends a lot of time alone and he <em>constantly </em>wants me to come visit.  I’ve been thinking about getting him a pet - do you think this is a good idea?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>Having a pet can offer a sense of well-being, encouragement and even a reason for living.  Being responsible for another life often gives new meaning to the lives of those who are living alone or who have experienced a loss.  Caring for and providing a loving home to an animal companion will also encourage your father to remain active and stay healthy.  However, I strongly suggest that you don’t surprise your father with a pet.  Instead, discuss the idea with him and see if he’s open to it, go pet shopping together so you can help him consider the costs, responsibilities and his lifestyle when making the decision!  For more information about adopting a pet, visit the Humane Society of the United States at: <a href=""http://www.hsus.org"">www.hsus.org</a> or call (202) 452-1100.

<strong>Q.  I recently visited my Aunt and she appears to have lost weight, she says she isn’t sleeping very well at night and she isn’t her usual happy and energetic self.  Should I be concerned?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>You should definitely take these changes seriously as the symptoms you have described could be signs of depression.  Depression is a medical illness and is nothing to be ashamed of.  Many seniors are prone to depression as they have many losses in their lives – family, friends, etc.  I would encourage her to talk about her feelings as this can help her understand why she is feeling this way.  It is also important that she sees a physician who can ascertain if she’s clinically depressed.  For more information visit the Geriatric Mental Health Foundation at:  <a href=""http://www.gmhfonline.org"">www.gmhfonline.org</a> or call (301) 654-7850.

<strong>Q.  What are some helpful tips for having a discussion with my Dad about his extremely dangerous driving skills?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>As difficult as it may seem, it's important that you approach your dad sooner rather than later about his driving. Whatever you do, try to stay calm when speaking with him ― he may be more receptive than you expect! It may take a few attempts to ease into the discussion. Lead the conversation with the idea of safety ― not only your father’s safety but also others on the road. Encourage him to share his own thoughts and concerns before discussing possible options. He may only need to make small adjustments to his driving routine such as driving only during the day. Lastly, realize that your dad may become upset or defensive. Research shows that men are typically more reluctant to quit driving than women; however, your continued concern and support will certainly help him feel more comfortable with this topic.

<strong>Q.  My father will be enrolling in the Medicare Part D Plan this year but we are having a hard time understanding the plan and how it works.  Where can we get some information about the plan that is easy to comprehend?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>Enrolling in the Part D plan of Medicare (the prescription drug plan) can be a very confusing process and your father is lucky to have you helping him!  You can talk to a Medicare Counselor at your State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program by going online to: <a href=""http://www.medicare.gov"">www.medicare.gov</a> and clicking on your state.  These counselors can answer all of your questions in detail and help you understand the plan.  Also, for more general information you can always call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) for additional help as you tackle the Medicare maze.

<strong>Q.  Every year my daughter bothers me about getting a flu shot and I keep telling her that I don’t need the shot because I had all my shots as a child.  Isn’t it true that my childhood vaccines protect me for life?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>Unfortunately when it comes to the flu, NO!  As you age, the strength of your immune system decreases and some of the protection offered by childhood vaccinations also begins to decrease making you more susceptible to diseases like the flu.  Since the flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses, the best way to prevent it is by getting a flu vaccination each year.  As always, make sure you talk to your physician about this vaccination to ensure that you’re a appropriate candidate for this shot.<strong></strong>

<strong>Q.  How can I convince my twin sister that giving up the keys to her car doesn’t mean giving up her independence?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>Today's mature Americans are among the most active and community-engaged seniors in our nation's history, and mobility and independence are essential to preserving those qualities. Use a respectful tone and speak from a position of concern. Stress your concern for her safety and the safety of others on the road. Be prepared to share alternative transportation options (e.g., how she can get to and from her local grocery store or the doctor’s office) and encourage her to gradually begin using them. Offer to accompany your aunt during the initial “trial run” of her new transportation option to show your support during this adjustment period.

<strong>Q.  This year my wife, who is a full-time caregiver for her mother, and I will be celebrating our 35<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary!  What can I do to show my “bride” - and the mother of my 4 children - how much we love and appreciate her?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>Congratulations on celebrating such a wonderful occasion!  How about renewing your vows.  What could be more romantic than for you to express your love and appreciation for your wife (and everything she does for the family!) by asking her to marry you all over again?  You can start by visiting the website “I Do, Take Two” which offers guidance on vow renewals (<a href=""http://www.idotaketwo.com"">www.idotaketwo.com</a>).  You will find a wealth of information on how to make your vow renewals both memorable and unique.  Here’s a heads up - if you want to get her a present, <em>traditional</em> 35<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary gifts have a theme of coral and more <em>contemporary </em>gifts have a theme of jade.

<strong>Q: My husband was just diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and I’m lost.  What are some tasks I should take care of in advance so that I can be the best caregiver possible?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>I’m so sorry to hear about your husband’s diagnosis, I wish you all the best on your caregiving journey.  The first thing you must do is get all of your papers and financial affairs in order.  This seems to be a common-sense type of thing but it’s one that is often put off until it’s too late.  At some point during his illness your husband will no longer be able to sign for himself and if you wait until then the situation will become much more complex. It is important not to just get a will made and signed, but to take care of all the other paper work. Mortgages and all debts should be caught up. You should consult with an experienced eldercare lawyer about the disposition of assets while your spouse is still considered legally competent. Also, make sure that you have other legal documents such as a Durable Power of Attorney (POA) filled out for both you and your spouse. Without a durable POA you may have to go and get a guardianship later in order to speak for your spouse and protect your spouse’s rights.  For more detailed information about how to prepare for your role as a spousal caregiver I suggest that you consult the Alzheimer Foundations website at <a href=""http://www.alz.org"">www.alz.org</a> or call their toll free number (800) 272-3900.

<strong>Q.  I will be 62 this year and I’m working part time, can I apply for Social Security benefits?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>You can apply as early as 62 for these benefits, but the amount you receive each month will be less than if you wait until full retirement (also called “normal retirement age”).  If you want to keep working while collecting Social Security, your payments may be reduced depending on the amount you earn from your job.  Once you reach full retirement age, there is no limit on the amount you can earn from working while collecting Social Security benefits.  For more information on estimating your potential benefit amounts using different retirement dates and levels of future earnings, visit <a href=""http://www.socialsecurity.gov"">www.socialsecurity.gov</a> or call 800-772-1213.

<strong>Q. My parents are moving in with me and I’m trying to make my home more “senior-friendly” for them.  I’ve heard the most dangerous place in the home for older adults is the bathroom - what can I do to make it safer?</strong>

<strong>A.  </strong>The bathroom is one of the most hazardous places in the home for accidents; as a matter of fact the majority of broken hips are the result of slipping in the bathtub. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that there are more than 300,000 bathroom accidents each year and that 2.5 million adults over the age of 65 need special assistance in bathing.  Here is a list of things you can do to help prevent these bathroom accidents:
<ul>
	<li>Install grab bars on the bathroom walls near the toilet and along the bathtub or shower.</li>
	<li>Place a slip-resistant rug adjacent to the bathtub for safe exit and entry.</li>
	<li>Mount a liquid soap dispenser on the bathtub/shower wall.</li>
	<li>Place nonskid adhesive textured strips on the bathtub/shower floor.</li>
	<li>A combination safety seat/transfer bench can be used in the bathroom to provide additional stability and comfort for transition in and out of the bathtub.</li>
	<li>Create a more stable toilet by using either a raised seat or a special toilet seat with armrests.</li>
	<li>Replace glass shower enclosures with non-shattering material.</li>
	<li> Place night lights between the bathroom and bedroom to help for safe maneuvering at night.</li>
</ul>

1317,"How to Be the Best Caregiver YOU can Be.....","Currently there are over 44 million ""caregivers"" caring for an aging loved one in the United States -- nearly one in four U.S. households is involved in caring for a relative or friend aged 50 or older.  It's estimated that more than 80 million people in the U.S. will have two or more chronic conditions by the year 2020.

Many caregivers are caught between the needs of their young families and the daunting task of caring for their elderly relatives. Watching a loved one grow old is filled with emotional upheaval, and when you compound that with other stresses—rush-hour traffic, deadlines, sick children, dirty laundry—caregivers are often left holding the bag. They feel a pressure to be all things to all people, often ending up as the martyr and giving themselves the short end of the stick.

Caregiving is largely a women's issue. Some 72 percent of caregivers are female, mostly wives and adult daughters. The average age of a caregiver is 47. More than one in three, however, are mature adults themselves (65 years of age and older). Caregiving can last from less than a year to over forty years. 80 percent of caregivers provide at least some type of unpaid assistance seven days a week. By 2030 one in five Americans will be at least 65, for a total of approximately 70 million older people, more than twice the number than hit 65 in 1996. Although it's well documented that the need for informal or ""family caregivers"" will rise exponentially over the next few decades, unfortunately the availability of this <em>type</em> of caregiver is expected to rapidly decline. Five social trends are affecting the projected serious decrease in the supply of unpaid caregivers in the future:
<ol>
	<li>Increasing divorce and remarriage rates</li>
	<li>Increasing geographic mobility</li>
	<li>Decreasing family size</li>
	<li>Delayed childbearing</li>
	<li>More women in the workplace</li>
</ol>
The stress on a caregiver can be devastating, especially if they are considered to be the primary caregiver in the family and have limited time due to their job and/or other familial responsibilities. The most common feeling informal primary caregivers have toward aging loved ones is guilt. Guilt can be destructive, making one feel tired, weak and immobile.

No matter how much you do, there may be times when you tell yourself that you could do better. Accept these feelings of guilt. Without recognition, guilt can be a destructive force. Know where these feelings come from and be aware that you are not alone in having such thoughts. The following tips will guide you on your way to saying goodbye to caregiver guilt.

<strong>10 Tips To Help You Say Goodbye To Caregiver Guilt</strong>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Acknowledge your feelings.</strong> Negative feelings can make us feel uneasy and guilty, but it’s important to understand that feelings of anger and resentment are natural and common. Unless these feelings control us, and our behavior toward our parents, they are not bad.</li>
	<li><strong>Think quality, not quantity.</strong> If you’re feeling guilty that you aren’t spending enough time with your aging loved ones, think of how you can improve the quality of your time together. Spending time reminiscing with your mother or playing a game of checkers with your father, for example, may mean more than cleaning their kitchen or delivering a pot roast.</li>
	<li><strong>Establish priorities. </strong>While no one has the time or energy to do everything for everybody, you must find time (and energy) to do the things that are most important to you. By establishing priorities - and allowing some flexibility for the unexpected - you can help ensure that the most important needs are met and the most important tasks get done.</li>
	<li><strong>Set limits.</strong> If your loved ones constant demands are running you ragged, decide and clearly acknowledge what you are able and willing to do for them. By setting limits and standing behind them, you can help reduce the guilt trips that come when you can’t meet their every demand.</li>
	<li><strong>Redefine your concept of caring.</strong> If you find it difficult to provide loving, ‘hands-on’ care for your parent, don’t feel guilty – simply think of other tangible ways you can help provide for their care.</li>
	<li><strong>Act from love, not from a sense of debt</strong>. If you think of caring for an aging loved one as repayment for all she’s done for you, you’ll always end up in the red. Instead, think of caregiving as one person helping another out of love.</li>
	<li><strong>Forgive and seek forgiveness</strong>. If your parent was abusive or uncaring when you were a child, now is the time to forgive – even if you truly feel he doesn’t deserve it. Holding grudges will not only affect your ability to care for your parent, but it will also hurt you.</li>
	<li><strong>Foster their independence. </strong>Don’t feel guilty for not doing things for your loved one that they could be doing for themselves. Instead, look for ways to help them do what they can. Something as simple as a $1.29 pill dispenser can help your parent become more independent - and can free up precious time for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Face the facts.</strong> Despite how much you want to help, sometimes your aging relative needs round-the-clock care and constant supervision that you can’t provide. When that happens, acknowledge that someone (or some place) may be better equipped to provide the majority of your parent’s care than you are.</li>
	<li><strong>Don’t succumb to peer pressure.</strong> Acknowledge, but don’t be unduly influenced by, the advice you get from friends and coworkers. Do what your heart tells you is best and what your circumstances permit.</li>

1318,"Healthy Exercise Tips for the 50+","It’s been widely accepted that if you have problems sleeping, notice your moods vary or that your anxiety is a bit high…..you may not be getting enough exercise!  Regular exercise doesn’t just improve your frame of mind; <strong><a href=""http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/03/05/even-a-little-exercise-can-improve-sleep/52231.html"">research</a></strong> also confirms it decreases anxiety, improves rest and raises ones self-esteem.  According to the <strong><a href=""http://www.seniorfitness.net/"">American Senior Fitness Association</a></strong>, 60 percent of mature adults are inactive and as a consequence many suffer from these symptoms. With heart disease, cancer and strokes serving as the leading causes of death for mature adults, staying physically active not only helps to <em>prevent</em> many illnesses, it can <em>improve</em> the health of people who already have debilitating diseases or disabilities.

As the countries 78 million baby boomers have begun aging, ""…there is a trend toward activities that are moderate in intensity and not so pounding on the body,"" says Richard Cotton, an exercise physiologist who is a spokesman for the American Council on Exercise. Comfort and lower injury risk are the major forces that have driven the switch to low-impact activities.  “Because older adults are more prone to musculoskeletal injury, low-impact exercises are ideal for them,"" Cotton says. In addition, it has been documented that mature adults are much more likely to stick with a less grueling routine over the long haul.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amstat.org/sections/SIS/Sports%20Data%20Resources/"">The American Sports Data Corporation</a></strong>, an organization which tracks exercise trends, also agrees that the hottest exercise trends for mature adults are those that demand less “power” yet still burn a significant number of calories.  The ASD's latest survey of 15,000 mature adults shows that althugh gym membership amongst the 55+ crowd has increased -- especially among women -- joint-jarring activities like aerobics and kickboxing are giving way to gentler pursuits such as pilates, yoga, tai chi, elliptical trainers and exercise bikes.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pilates - </strong>Originally designed to give dancers muscle strength without bulk, Pilates was largely ignored by the general public for almost a century. Only two years ago, fewer than 10 percent of gyms offered classes in mat Pilates, a blend of stretching and calisthenics designed to enhance alignment, increase flexibility, and firm abdominal and back muscles. Currently almost 40% of facilities offer Pilates as a regular exercise class. Pilates is a body conditioning system made up of various exercises that help mature adults build strength by improving flexibility, agility and economy of motion. Pilates can even help alleviate chronic ailments and back pain - all without building excess bulk. It has also been noted that with this type of fitness program there is often a marked improvement in posture and an increase in joint stability.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Yoga - </strong>Americans first turned to the 5,000-year-old stretching and relaxation technique in the 1960s, looking for a way to get “high” without drugs. Now, the yoga/tai chi category boasts over 11 million followers, almost double the 5.7 million who participated in 1998. Yoga helps mature adults maintain a fitter body, calmer mind and feel more relaxed.  Recent studies have shown that Yoga can normalize your blood pressure and even balance your nervous system all while using breathing techniques to cleanse your air passages; this cleansing also helps mature adults prevent respiratory ailments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Elliptical Trainers and Recumbent Bikes - </strong>More than 10 million Americans currently use elliptical trainers, a knee-friendly cross between a stair climber and a cross-country-ski machine. That's a surge of 177% over the 1998 level of 3.9 million -- and a sign that elliptical trainers have passed the litmus test of health club acceptance.  More than 10 million Americans now recline while they pedal using recumbent bikes, an increase of about 50% since 1998. Not only are these machines more comfy than ordinary exercise bikes for mature adults, they also alleviate considerable amounts of stress off achy lower backs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Tai Chi - </strong>Tai Chi is an ancient Chinese martial arts program that is said to help mature adults improve their balance and potentially avoid falls.  According to Mayo Clinic research one of out every three adults 65+ is involved in an accident resulting in a fall.  The slow, gentle and soothing movements of Tai Chi help older adults develop stronger muscles, improve balance control, enhance concentration and stabilize psychological well-being.  The movements and philosophy of Tai Chi also teach one to relax, slow down, coordinate the mind and body and improve posture.</li>
</ul>
Fitness experts warn that by itself, any one of these low-impact exercises is not enough to stay fit.  I recently posted a <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlL314y0s40"">video interview</a> </strong>with the founder of the <strong><a href=""http://www.icaa.cc/"">International Council on Active Aging</a></strong>, Colin Milner, about the benefits of exercise and staying active as we age.  While aging boomers are fueling the exercise trend toward kinder, gentler workouts, experts say that anyone who wants to stay fit -- particularly beginning exercisers -- should also consider incorporating low-intensity activities into their routine. The ideal routine combines the strength, flexibility, and balance training of yoga and pilates with an aerobic activity such as brisk walking.  Whatever exercise program you decide to embrace, remember to always check with your physician before you begin.

1319,"Are You Parenting Your Parent?","You make every effort to care for your parent.  But instead of acting grateful for all you do, you get grief for what you <em>don’t </em>do.  Sound familiar?  Regardless of how often you’re with your aging loved one or how long you stay with them when you visit, the response is the same from your parents when it’s time for you to leave.  “Why are you in such a hurry to go?”…or….”What’s more important than your parents?”……

Many caregivers tell me they are greeted by their loved one with “Hello, stranger” or “It’s about time you came to see your old man,” even if they just visited a few days before.  Others tell me that their parents don’t seem to enjoy the time they’re together because they are so concerned about the time they <em>aren’t</em> together!  If your parent’s remarks make you feel like screaming or just stopping your visits altogether, avoid making any rash decisions.  First consider the reasons he or she may be acting this way.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>The need for reassurance.</em></strong>  At a time in their lives that is characterized by loss – of their friends and loved ones, health, abilities, and so forth – your parents may be scared that they will lose you too.  Assure them that you still love them and will be there when they need you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>Jealousy.</em></strong>  Although it’s hard to think of parents being jealous of their children, it happens.  You have your health, your family, your job, your life, your independence and probably many opportunities they never had.  They may see any or all of these things as competition for your interest and affections.  If you really loved them, they reason, you’d put them before the other interests in your life.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>Difference of Perspective.</em></strong>  For many caregivers with jobs and other commitments, devoting even a few hours to caring for aging parents is difficult.  A couple of hours in the evening seems like a long time when you’ve worked all day and you have more work - and possibly a family deserving of your attention - waiting for you when you get home.  On the other hand, for the mature adult with few responsibilities at this time in their lives and perhaps few interests except for a grown child, a few hours seems insignificant compared to the long, tedious hours they’re alone.  Seeing you provides a respite from boredom and loneliness.  No wonder why they don’t want you to leave.  And they’re likely to resort to guilt tactics to keep you there longer and make you feel like you need to come back sooner.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>Forgetfulness.</em></strong>  If your aging loved one is cognitively impaired, perhaps he or she doesn’t remember that you visited just yesterday or that you’ve been sitting on the sofa together for three hours.  If a cognitively impaired parent argues that you are late or haven’t visited, there is no reason to start a fight by telling him just how often or how long you do visit.  Nor is there reason to feel guilty if your parent insinuates that you “don’t care” if you don’t spend enough time with her.  You can gently tell her that you do love being with her but that the need to earn a living or care for your own family or home makes it impossible to spend as much time with her as you would like.  Reassure her that you’re always nearby, and in the event of an emergency, you will do all you can to get to her as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
Of course, even if your aging loved one still has all her faculties, she will most likely want more time and attention than you can offer.  One solution is to help your parent find other interests - besides you!  Having other places to direct their attention will help relieve boredom.  Encourage other family members and friends to visit your mother or take her out if she’s able.  Check into adult day care programs or activities at a nearby senior center.  If your parent attends a place of worship, find out if they offer events for seniors.
<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Krasn3gORG0?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></div>
Simple cards and gifts can be a good way to reassure an older adult who fears abandonment.  A gift such as a large-print book, a videotape, a craft kit or a gift certificate from her favorite store or restaurant will serve double-duty.  She’ll have the pleasure of opening the gift and knowing you’re thinking of her and she’ll also have an activity to look forward to or something to keep her busy.

But, if you do decide to try these strategies, be careful.  You don’t want your parent to constantly expect gifts or planned activities.  Nor do you want gifts and activities to replace the time you spend with her.  Even so, a few dollars and an hour or so of planning now and then – when combined with your own reassurance – can let her know you care, improve her mood and perhaps help reduce the number of times you have to hear, “It’s about time you came for a visit” or “Why are you in such a hurry to leave?”

1320,"Corporate America’s Caregiver Crisis","I recently gave a keynote speech to a room comprised of 1000 or so “C-level” female executives – the topic was how to balance caregiving and a career.  As take-charge women they were there to learn tools to help them cope with the arduous tasks associated with caregiving for an aging loved one while simultaneously keeping up with the intense demands of their careers.  I decided to kickoff my presentation by asking the audience how many of them had employee benefit packages that included <em>eldercare</em> options.  To my absolute amazement less than 100 people raised their hand!  A myriad of questions began racing through my mind….Do they even know what I’m talking about when I say eldercare benefits?  If so, did they not inquire as to whether this benefit was a part of their “package” when they were hired?  Are eldercare benefits actually<em> not</em> currently being offered as an employment benefit these days?  I was astonished…..

As the number of employees juggling the care of an older loved one escalates, these working caregivers are increasingly torn between the pressing needs of their families and unyielding obligations to their employers.  Clearly, most employers fail to recognize the overwhelming consequences of their employees <em>unresolved</em> eldercare issues - the outcome of this oversight will most certainly create a sobering financial hit to these organizations bottom line.  A recent survey conducted by MetLife, which estimates the aggregate cost of caregiving in lost productivity to United States businesses at approximately $34 billion per year, irrefutably elucidates this assumption!  Yet to my incredulity, only about one in four companies currently offer elder care benefits.

Even if corporate eldercare benefits do exist on paper, most employees say their supervisor's negative attitude toward eldercare heavily influences their limited use of these perks. Apparently many managers are perceived to be sending mixed signals if employees try to use these benefits.  This seems especially prevalent in the case of an older employee and a younger manager, in which the manager may not have had any previous experience caregiving for an aging loved one.  With that being said, it’s estimated that supervisors spend 55.7 million hours of company time per year dealing with issues specifically related to employed caregivers, for a total cost to businesses of over $800 million annually.

This impending “employee caregiving crisis” is not surprising however, when you consider that an estimated 65 million people – 29% of the United States population - currently provide informal care for a chronically ill, disabled or aged family member or friend during any given year.  It’s alarming to note that most caregivers are cited as tending to their parents, or other mature relatives, an <em>average </em>of 20 hours per week – 13% of family caregivers report that they actually provide an astounding 40 hours (or more) of care a week.  The emotional and financial burdens that weigh on caregivers affect their work performance. Most caregivers have jobs, but 70 percent make workplace adjustments like leaving early to take a parent to the doctor, according to AARP research.

As of January 1<sup>st</sup> 2011, each day 10,000 baby boomers started turning 65 years of age - the average 65-year-old today can expect to live another 20.4 years.  Statistics show that 85% of persons 65 years of age, and over, will require some form of caregiving assistance within their lifetime.  These figures are undoubtedly expected to rise significantly as our population continues to “age up” appreciably over the next decade.

Providing eldercare can be an unexpected rollercoaster of emotional, physical, and financial drains for caregivers.  It’s this <em>complex</em> and <em>unpredictable</em> maelstrom that exemplifies the need for companies to be aware of, and prepared for, the demands of employees providing care.  The most common challenges that employed caregivers face include: taking unpaid leaves of absence or using personal or sick days to provide care; coming to work late/leaving work early; refusing relocation or work-related travel; and declining overtime work or new assignments.  If employers want to sustain a healthy work environment and the highest level of productivity, they must support “caregiver-friendly” policies that include innovative eldercare benefits.

The issue of eldercare benefits has become especially important to women, in as much as they make up approximately 66% of the caregivers in the U.S.  The typical family caregiver is a 49-year-old woman caring for her widowed 69-year-old mother who doesn’t (currently) live with her.  She’s married, employed and more than 37% of these female caregivers have children or grandchildren under 18 years old also living with them.  This group is commonly referred to as the “sandwich generation” and is made up of those folks who are <em>caught</em> between taking care of their aging loved ones and their children simultaneously.

During the 2009 economic downturn, 1 in 5 family caregivers stated that their finances were so <em>strained</em> that they were forced to move into the same home with their aging loved ones to cut down on their annual expenses.  Incredibly, 47% of working caregivers indicate that an increase in caregiving expenses has caused them to use up <em>all</em> or <em>most </em>of their savings.  It’s estimated that the average family caregiver spends at least $5,500 per year on <em>out of pocket </em>caregiving expenses – long distance caregivers are projected to be spending in excess of $8,500 annually!

Caregiver’s health is unquestionably being negatively impacted with over 20% of family caregivers self-reporting their health is “fair or poor” at best!  63% of caregivers report having poorer eating habits than non-caregivers and 58% indicate worse exercise habits than before caregiving responsibilities.  In addition, over 20% of employed female caregivers report symptoms of depression compared to 8% of their non-caregiving peers.  Not to mention, family caregivers experiencing extreme stress have been shown to “age” prematurely – it’s estimated that this level of stress can take as much as 10 years off a family caregiver's life!

With all of this being said, and at the risk of sounding completely dismissive, I do want to take a moment to give a <em>“shout out”</em> to a few of the companies that ARE offering at least some type of eldercare benefits:

<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Prudential Financial</span></strong> – they let workers make a $100 co-payment and hire a geriatric-care specialist.

<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">McGraw-Hill</span></strong> - permits employees to enroll one other adult family member, which can be an elderly relative, on their health-insurance plan at regular family rates.

<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Verizon Communications</span></strong> – (the Verizon Wireless division) offers emergency in-home care, and has even extended the benefit to some part-time employees.

<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Freddie Mac</span></strong> - offers monthly support groups for those caring for family members and provides emergency elder home care, for which employees pay $15 a day.

<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">AstraZeneca</span></strong> - employees can get six hours a year with a geriatric care expert who will help them access, and hopefully palliate, their caregiving situation.

<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">IBM</span></strong><strong> - </strong>offers discounted long-term-care insurance, an ambulance at the touch of a button, and free software to assist employees who are using the internet to find caregiver resources.

The rest of corporate America MUST wake up and start to recognize these seemingly perennial caregiving trends – if for no other reason than to strengthen their bottom line!  Employees caring for elderly loved ones cost employers 8% more in <em>health care expenses</em> - estimated to be worth $13.4 billion per year.  Recently released research indicated that six in 10 family caregivers are currently employed.  66% of these employees stated that they’ve routinely been forced to make some adjustments to their work life, from reporting late to work to giving up work entirely; and 1 in 5 family caregivers have had to take a family leave of absence.  Eldercare in the workplace, although still largely unaddressed, has become one of the fastest growing work-family employee challenges to emerge in the past decade.  Eldercare is indeed quickly catching up to childcare as the “hot button issue” facing personnel today and these employees indubitably deserve to understand how their employers will be assisting them - emotionally, physically and financially - to help stabilize this ongoing caregiving crisis.

1321,"Are Women Over 50 Shaping America’s Political Destiny?","What a year 2016 has been! For American politics, it’s the year women <em>truly</em> came into their own as a political force. By now we are all clearly aware that it was the first time in history that a woman was nominated as the presidential candidate of a major party. That was no small feat. Since first being granted the right to vote in 1920 with the passing of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, and the subsequent extension of that right to all women, not just white women, in August 1965, women have been highly marginalized in the political arena. This is the case despite the fact that statistics show over and over that we hold a significant sway on the outcomes of elections.

The 2012 elections were a classic example; <em><a href=""http://www.voterunlead.org"">Vote Run Lead</a></em> reported that exit polls indicated 53% of the voters were women. Effectively, we determined the outcome of that election. This was a continuation of the momentum of the 2008 elections, which was defined by a marked majority of female voters – 65.7 % of women voted as opposed to 61.5 % of men.

The stats become even more interesting when we dissect them further. Of the voters in the 2008 and 2012 elections, 48.5 % were aged between 18 and 24, compared with approximately 74% of voters aged over 50. It is fair to conclude from these statistics that women over the age of 50 formed a large proportion of the voters.

The impact of women on politics has continued to grow, and this year an estimated 72.8% of women registered to vote. Interestingly, <em>older</em> women were far more active and the demographics of older age groups of female voters were estimated as follows:

<strong>45-54</strong> = 73.5 %

<strong>55-64</strong> = 76.6 %

<strong>65-74</strong> = 78.1 %

These statistics show that the 50+ woman takes her civic responsibility very seriously, that much is clear; but do they tell us anything more? Yes, they do, as a matter of fact. According to a 2014 <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/05/when-discussing-politics-family-plays-larger-role-for-women-than-for-men/"">Survey</a> by the Pew Research Center, Americans stay informed about politics and the elections by talking to others, and women are far more likely to talk to family members about politics, while men speak to external parties. Forty-four percent of women 65 and older, shared that they speak to their children about politics. Considering this, there is no question that older women play a significant role in shaping the political views and activities of younger family members, including younger women.

Irrespective of political view or motivation, these statistics speak volumes. Women appear to become more politically active as they age and women over the age of 50 hold undeniable political clout. The question is why? By all accounts, women are motivated to be politically active by far more than just the desire to vote for the party of their choice – women vote because they care deeply about the world around them, and they want to do their part to make that world a better place. In general, the over 50 population is a significant demographic to pay attention to in the near term as <a href=""https://www.immersionactive.com/resources/size-wealth-spending-50-consumers/"">one in three</a> Americans are currently over 50, representing a significant chunk of the electorate. This trend will only continue as population growth declines and longevity increases.

But the 50+ woman’s influence on the political stage is not just in relation to votes. They are also using their increasingly stronger positions in the workplace as well as growing financial clout to help propel their preferred candidates to success. The collective economic power of women is becoming a major game changer by itself. According to the New York Times, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/us/politics/womens-donors-influence-in-politics.html"">women bankrolled political campaigns</a> in 2016 more than ever before. Women as a group have taken control of over <a href=""http://time.com/money/4360112/womens-wealth-share-increase/"">$39.6 trillion</a> of the <em>world's</em> wealth. Their purchasing power is formidable and growing. By 2030, women in North America alone are expected to stand in control of <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/10/20/dispelling-myths-about-women-and-charitable-giving/"">$33.5 trillion</a>.

Even more significant, over the next decade <em>older women</em> will be the beneficiaries of one of the largest transfers of wealth in our country's history. Many women, Baby Boomers in particular, will <a href=""http://time.com/money/2992759/what-do-women-investors-want/"">receive a double inheritance</a>, from both their parents and husbands. This will heighten their profiles both as key stakeholders in the economy and as highly influential actors in the family/social sphere. In addition, research indicates that as American women age, they typically exercise even more control over the family finances.

Although women are more financially empowered and more highly educated than any time in history the spending clout of this key demographic goes far beyond the raw economic implications. Women as entrepreneurs make up <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Women%20and%20Girls_Entrepreneurship%20and%20Innovation.pdf"">36 percent </a> of U.S. businesses. The decision-making power women represent can shape markets, influence media coverage of issues and generate compelling insights in all areas of relevant content. This powerful group is setting trends in industries from consumer products to healthcare to financial services. Meanwhile, women will continue to gain and wield clout as they assume more seats in the boardrooms and inside the C-suite. Highly active, technologically savvy and politically informed, this collection of women will face opportunities, and challenges, that can't even be predicted right now.

Given the considerable clout they possess, it is an anomaly that women over 50 do not hold more political positions. It is not for lack of ability – women are <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/study-women-are-better-leaders-2014-1"">perceived</a> to be better leaders – in fact - a 2014 <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/174002/americans-say-business-background-best-governing.aspx"">Gallup poll</a> showed that 63 percent of respondents believed that the U.S. would be governed better if there were more women in political office. However, getting women there remains a challenge. Here in the U.S., women still hold <a href=""http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2015"">less than 20 percent</a> of congressional seats, despite composing a majority of the U.S. population. We are far behind other Western countries, which have made great strides in getting women into political offices. Sweden has 45 percent female representation at the national level, Finland, 42.5 percent, Denmark and the Netherlands, 39 percent and Germany, 36.5 percent. These countries made such progress by being proactive. Most of their political parties prioritize <a href=""https://www.thenation.com/article/why-does-us-still-have-so-few-women-office/"">recruitment of female candidates</a>, including through the use of quotas.

The recent elections offer us, as a nation, an opportunity to begin to address that challenge. Our politicians need to recognize the value the 50+ woman brings to the table and give her the chance to make a meaningful contribution. She has already demonstrated that her vote is so much more than just casting her ballot, it is an important factor that’s helping to determine the course of the nation. Politicians would do well to heed this. As the incoming administration makes various important decisions, including the appointment of key administration officials and Supreme Court judges, the 50+ woman must not be forgotten. She has much to contribute and her wealth of experience <em>must </em>be utilized for the benefit of this country. As the last election has made clear, women have a voice that pundits, pollsters and policy makers most definitely need to hear.

The collective power of women by no means negates the many differences among them, which however are equally important and should not be glossed over. Women of different socioeconomic and cultural groups may prioritize very different issues. Listening to different voices is key. For example, whereas affluent and professional women in their 50s are often approaching the zenith of their power in their careers and personal lives, working-class women may find themselves pushed out of the job market and into poverty. In both cases, women have important insights for policy makers to consider when implementing domestic policy.

In addition to all of the above reasons, there are two other very good reasons why women are essential to policy makers: the young and the old. Women are needed to mentor girls and young women as they become the next generation of strong leaders. They are also looking out for our most fragile citizens. Being the primary decision maker and often in charge of end-of-life planning, women are often more in touch with the needs of Americans who are getting older and need care. Listening to the voices of women and responding to their needs can help policymakers craft forward-looking policies that empower women to help build a better tomorrow.

Perhaps one of the most valuable clues to why women over 50 play such a powerful role in the politics of America is their worldview – they have lived enough to understand what really matters, and along the way they have known injustice and struggle. They have a well-developed view of the big picture and their motives and aspirations are seldom selfish. They are dedicated to making the world a better place for their children and their fellow man.

1345,"Ease the Burden of Spousal Caregiving","I recently had the pleasure of spending time with John and Marianne while hosting Lifetime Network’s show <a href=""http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/designing-spaces"">Designing Spaces: Aging in Place</a> (airing Nov. 3rd at 7:30 am). Marianne recently suffered a stroke and as a result, experienced multiple falls in her home. These incidents propelled her husband John into the role of primary caregiver. Before the falls John was an active golfer, attended the gym regularly and enjoyed spending time in the garden. Now John spends all of his time making sure that Marianne doesn’t fall again and has all but given up on his hobbies. John, like many other spousal caregivers, is at high risk for experiencing caregiver burnout.

More than 605 million people across the country currently provide an estimated $375 billion in “free” caregiving services for a chronically ill, disabled or aged spouse, family member or friend during any given year. That is almost twice as much as is actually spent on homecare and nursing home services combined ($158 billion). According to the Family Caregiving Alliance, there is a much higher likelihood of receiving care from a spouse than from an adult child. In fact, nearly one-quarter, 22 percent, of caregivers who are currently caring for a spouse are themselves over the age of 65.

Caregivers often are so busy caring for others that they tend to neglect their own emotional, physical, and spiritual health. The demands on a caregiver’s body, mind, and emotions can easily seem overwhelming, leading to fatigue and hopelessness — and, ultimately, burnout. Spousal caregivers are especially prone to “burnout” because the significant changes in the marital relationship can often leave the spouse who is giving the care feeling overwhelmed and stressed. This anxiety can be compounded if the caregiver is also taking over responsibilities that were once handled solely by their ailing spouse, from cooking and doing laundry, to balancing the checkbook and heading up the financial decisions. In addition, there is very often a considerable sense of loss when one is involved in caring for their spouse. This is especially prevalent if ones spouse suffers from significant cognitive decline or if activities that once provided pleasure and deepened a sense of connection are no longer possible.

Caregiving spouses often begin to feel very isolated from friends and feel tremendous guilt about their own unmet needs. Subsequently, they take on this “labor of love” and let their own positive health habits drop off to the side, putting their health at risk.  In fact, the Journal of American Medical Association reports that if one is a spousal caregiver between the ages of 66 and 96, and is experiencing ongoing mental or emotional strain as a result of their caregiving duties, there is a 63 percent increased risk of dying over those people in the same age group who are not caring for a spouse. The combination of loss, prolonged stress, the physical demands of caregiving and the health vulnerabilities that simply come with age place an older spousal caregiver in a danger zone.

Spousal caregivers especially need to know and recognize the symptoms of burnout and how best to cope. It is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion that may be accompanied by a change in attitude — from positive and caring to negative and unconcerned. Burnout can occur when spousal caregivers don’t get the help they need or if they try to do more than they are able — either physically or financially. Here are some tips to help identify and address someone who is experiencing spousal caregiver burnout.
<strong>
Q: What are some of the signs that a spousal caregiver is experiencing burnout?</strong>
• Missing or delaying their own doctor appointments
• Ignoring their own health problems or symptoms
• Not eating a healthy diet for lack of time
• Overusing tobacco and alcohol when they feel stressed
• Giving up exercise habits for lack of time
• Losing sleep
• Losing connections with friends for lack of time to socialize
• Bottling up feelings of anger and frustration and then being surprised by angry, even violent, outbursts directed at your spouse, other family members, co-workers – even strangers
• Feeling sad, down, depressed or hopeless
• Loss of energy
• Lacking interest in things that used to give them (and their spouse) pleasure
• Feeling resentful toward their spouse
• Blaming their spouse for the situation
• Feeling that people ask more of them than they should
• Feeling like caregiving has affected family relationships in a negative way
• Feeling annoyed by other family members who don’t help out or who criticize their level of care

<strong>Q: What are some of the long-term effects of spousal caregiver burn out?</strong>
Stress of spousal caregiving for persons with dementia has been shown to impact a person’s immune system for up to three years after their caregiving ends thus increasing their chances of developing a chronic illness themselves. Also, spousal caregivers experiencing extreme stress have been shown to age prematurely. This level of stress can take as much as 10 years off a spousal caregiver’s life.

<strong>Q: What is the best way to prevent burnout?</strong>
Here are ten great tips that were provided by the Family Caregivers Association….
• Caregiving is a job and respite is your earned right. Reward yourself with respite breaks often.
• Watch out for signs of depression and don’t delay in getting professional help when you need it.
• When people offer to help to help, accept the offer and suggest specific things that they can do to help.
• Educate yourself about your loved one’s condition and how to communicate effectively with doctors.
• There’s a difference between caring and doing. Be open to technologies and ideas that promote your loved one’s independence.
• Trust your instincts. Most of the time they’ll lead you in the right direction.
• Caregivers often do a lot of lifting, pushing, and pulling. Be good to your back.
• Grieve for your loss and then allow yourself to dream new dreams.
• Seek support from other caregivers. There is great strength in knowing you are not alone.
• Stand up for your rights as a caregiver and a citizen.

<strong>Q: Why do some spousal caregivers have a hard time asking for help?</strong>
Because they feel that asking for help is a sign they aren’t handling the situation well. But the truth is…your spouse/partner will be in better hands if you, yourself have some help. It is important to have people to support you, while taking care of someone else.

<strong>Q: What are some preparations that a spousal caregiver can make to help ease the pressure?</strong>
Get papers and affairs out of the way: This seems to be a common-sense type of thing but it is one that is often put off until it is too late. If the spouse has Alzheimer’s disease and can no longer sign for him/herself matters are dramatically more complex. It is important not to just get a will made and signed, but to take care of all the other paper work. Mortgages and all debts should be caught up. You should consult with an experienced elder lawyer about the disposition of assets while your spouse is still considered legally competent. Make sure that you have other legal documents such as durable Powers of Attorney filled out for both you and your spouse. Without a durable POA you may have to go get a guardianship later in order to speak for your spouse and protect your spouse’s rights.

<strong>Q: What are some of the more positive aspects of being a spousal caregiver?</strong>
While caregiving can be a very stressful situation for many spousal caregivers, studies also show that there are beneficial effects, including feeling positive about being able to help a disabled spouse, feeling appreciated by the care recipient, and feeling that their relationship with the care recipient had improved.

1355,"Home Safety for the Senior in Your Life","As our loved ones grow older, it’s very important to create an environment where they feel safe and empowered to age in place.  While hosting <a href=""http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/designing-spaces"">Designing Spaces: Aging in Place</a> (airing Nov. 3rd at 7:30 am)<i> </i>for Lifetime Network, I learned about Marianne and John’s caregiving journey. Earlier in the year Marianne suffered from a stroke and fell multiple times. Her husband John and daughter Maureen have taken on the responsibility of caregiving. During our time together, we discussed the importance of “caring for the caregiver” by introducing new technologies and external agencies that help provide respite for John and Maureen, while also making Marianne feel empowered to age in place. The following article will outline other modifications John and Marianne can make in their home to minimize the risk of future falls.

The center for disease control reports that among people 65 years and older, falls are the leading cause of injury deaths and the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma. Each year in the United States, nearly one third of older adults experience a fall.  The majority of falls occur at home and most fractures reported by older adults are the result of a fall. Falls can lead to a tragic loss of an older person’s independence and mobility. Given the vastly growing population of the 65<strong>+</strong>age group, the direct costs (nationally) for nonfatal injuries related to falls is expected to reach as much as $44 billion by 2020.

Each year, more than 734,000 people over 65 are treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with stairs, bathtubs, furniture, carpeting and other products seniors live with and use every day. Thousands of these injuries are related to falls: 3,000 seniors each year fall while standing on chairs; 6,800 seniors trip on rugs or carpet runners. Many of these accidents could be prevented.  It is estimated that simple modifications to the interior of the house can cut a mature adults risk of falling in half.  Changes in furniture arrangement, housekeeping and lighting will definitely help reduce the risk of falling at home. Below is a list of important questions and answers to help you determine if your aging loved ones home, or your own home, is safe for a mature adult.

<strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: Where in the home is considered the most dangerous place that seniors need to be most careful?</strong>

The bathroom is one of the most hazardous places in the home for accidents; the majority of broken hips are the result of slipping in the bathtub. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that there are more than 300,000 bathroom accidents each year and that 2.5 million adults over the age of 65 need special assistance in bathing.

<strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: What are some of the best things to do to prevent these bathroom accidents?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Install grab bars on the bathroom walls near the toilet and along the bathtub or shower.</li>
 	<li>Place a slip-resistant rug adjacent to the bathtub for safe exit and entry.</li>
 	<li>Mount a liquid soap dispenser on the bathtub/shower wall.</li>
 	<li>Place nonskid adhesive textured strips on the bathtub/shower floor.</li>
 	<li>A combination safety seat/transfer bench can be used in the bathroom to provide additional stability and comfort for transition in and out of the bathtub.</li>
 	<li>Stabilize yourself on the toilet by using either a raised seat or a special toilet seat with armrests.</li>
 	<li>Replace glass shower enclosures with non-shattering material.</li>
 	<li>Place night lights between the bathroom and bedroom to help for safe maneuvering at night.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: What about stairs and steps, what should be done?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure light switches are at both the top and bottom of the stairs.</li>
 	<li>Provide enough light to see each step and the top and bottom landings.</li>
 	<li>Keep flashlights nearby in case of a power outage.</li>
 	<li>Install handrails on both sides of the stairway and be sure to use them.</li>
 	<li>Do not leave objects on the stairs.</li>
 	<li>Consider installing motion detector lights, which turn on automatically and light your stairway.</li>
 	<li>Put nonslip treads on each bare-wood step.</li>
 	<li>Do not use patterned, dark, or deep-pile carpeting. Solid colors show the edges of steps more clearly.</li>
 	<li>Do not place loose area rugs at the bottom or top of stairs.</li>
 	<li>Repair loose stairway carpeting or boards immediately.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: What are some home safety tips for living areas?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Arrange furniture to create clear pathways between rooms.</li>
 	<li>Remove low coffee tables, magazine racks, footrests, and plants from pathways in rooms.</li>
 	<li>Install easy-access light switches at entrances to rooms so you won’t have to walk into a darkened room in order to turn on the light. Glow-in-the-dark switches may be helpful.</li>
 	<li>Secure loose area rugs with double-faced tape or slip-resistant backing. Recheck these rugs periodically.</li>
 	<li>Keep electric, appliance, and telephone cords out of your pathways, but don’t put cords under a rug.</li>
 	<li>Eliminate wobbly chairs, ladders, and tables.</li>
 	<li>Do not sit in a chair or on a sofa that is so low it is difficult to stand up.</li>
 	<li>Place carpeting over concrete, ceramic, and marble floors to lessen the severity of injury if you fall.</li>
 	<li>Repair loose wooden floorboards immediately.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: How about the Kitchen?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Remove throw rugs.</li>
 	<li>Immediately clean up any liquid, grease, or food spilled on the floor.</li>
 	<li>Store food, dishes, and cooking equipment at easy-to-reach waist-high level.</li>
 	<li>Don’t stand on chairs or boxes to reach upper cabinets. Use only a step stool with an attached handrail so you are supported.</li>
 	<li>Repair loose flooring.</li>
 	<li>Use nonskid floor wax.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: And Bedrooms?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Clear clutter from the floor.</li>
 	<li>Place a lamp and flashlight near your bed.</li>
 	<li>Again, install night-lights along the route between the bedroom and the bathroom.</li>
 	<li>Sleep on a bed that is easy to get into and out of.</li>
 	<li>Keep a telephone near your bed.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Q</em></strong><strong>: Do you have any additional home safety tips?</strong>

Yes, smoke detectors should be installed in the home and checked periodically to be sure that they work. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) home fires are more deadly than all others combined and for those individuals 65 or older, the fire death risk is twice as high as that of the average population.

A bathroom remodel for seniors is certainly a challenge, especially when it comes to your loved ones. Wheelchair or walker accessibility, space for assistance when it is needed, and choosing 'arthritis-friendly' fixtures are just a few things to consider.
<h3>Spacious Bathrooms for Older Adults</h3>
Leaving enough space to maneuver a wheelchair to the shower, toilet, or vanity will save you a great deal of trouble in the end. If you choose to expand your bathroom space, it might require moving plumbing, or even breaking down and rebuilding walls. This is a big step, and you’ll want to do this first, and you might even consider hiring a professional contractor.
<h3>Ensuring Wheelchair/Walker Accessibility</h3>
Forcing a wheelchair or walker through an exceedingly narrow doorway can result in damage to the door jams, surrounding walls, and even your equipment or loved one. There is nothing simple about widening the entry to a room, and subsequently replacing the door. If you need only a couple of extra inches, swing away door hinges might be a simpler solution than renovating, and they can be found at most local hardware stores.
<h3>Using Handles and Hardware that are Easy to Grasp</h3>
There are several health conditions that may limit an older person’s ability to grasp traditional round handles. While improving bathrooms for older adults, consider installing more ergonomic lever-style handles for doors, showers, and cabinets. For ease of faucet use, look for touch top designs that require only a simple tap of the wrist to activate.
<h3>Creating Level Floors</h3>
Having multiple steps, or too high steps, can be troublesome. You may wish to install or build a ramp, which should have no more than a 5 degree (1:12) incline per ADA standard. However, in some circumstances, it might make more sense to raise the floor.
<h3>Remodeling Showers for Seniors</h3>
Bathing can be one of the more difficult tasks for an older adult. Stepping over a high ledge into a tub or shower is only a small task, compared to sitting in a deep tub to take a bath. It is important to provide safe showers for seniors. A nice choice is a shower with a very low or no threshold; this practical design would instead be gently sloped toward your drain to prevent flooding. Another option is a walk in tub. This is a nice option for those who particularly enjoy soaking in a bath.
<h3>Raising the Toilet</h3>
In terms of bathrooms for older adults, using the toilet can sometimes present a particularly difficult challenge. A quicker and less expensive option would be to use a removable seat with handles, these can be found at medical supply stores or  online. If you are looking for a more inviting and permanent fix, you can install a toilet that is taller on its own.
<h3>Making the Vanity More Inviting</h3>
A bathroom remodel for seniors should include a seated vanity space which makes them feel comfortable and at ease, confident in their ability to care for themself. Designing an area around wheelchair accessibility, where styling and grooming tools are easily within reach is important. Also, consider a mounted mirror that is either movable or tilted downward from the wall so that it can be used while seated.
<h3>Bathing Solutions for Older Adults</h3>
When building showers for older adults, there are several measures that can be taken to make bathing a more pleasant and worry-free experience. First, it is important to provide seating. A removable seat with handles can be purchased and used, but built in seating is even more convenient and easier to keep clean. Second, install easy to grip grab bars in multiple positions. It is important to remember to reinforce shower walls to ensure that they can withstand the weight of an adult. Third, look to make the showerhead as easy to access as possible.
<h3>Increasing Lighting</h3>
It is important to provide extra lighting for older individuals whom may be visually impaired. Make for several options of lighting such as night lights for the evening, or sky lights to bring in ample quantities of rejuvenating sunlight. Motion activated lights are great, especially for those who use walkers, canes, or wheelchairs.
<h3>Fall-Proofing the Floor</h3>
If your older loved one takes a fall, they may be at risk of great injury. It is important for bathrooms for older adults to have no-slip coating in the tub or shower, and plush mats on the floors to reduce the chance of a fall occuring.

A bathroom remodel for seniors might prove to be a rather large undertaking. However, you’ll gain peace of mind knowing the your older loved one has a safe place where they can maintain their independence.

There are several health conditions that may limit an elderly person’s ability to grasp traditional round handles. While improving bathrooms for the elderly, consider installing more ergonomic lever-style handles for doors, showers, and cabinets. For ease of faucet use, look for touch top designs that require only a simple tap of the wrist to activate.
<h3>Creating Level Floors</h3>
Having multiple steps, or too high steps, can be troublesome. You may wish to install or build a ramp, which should have no more than a 5 degree (1:12) incline per ADA standard. However, in some circumstances, it might make more sense to raise the floor.
<h3>Remodeling Showers for Elderly</h3>
Bathing can be one of the more difficult tasks for an elderly person. Stepping over a high ledge into a tub or shower is only a small task, compared to sitting in a deep tub for a bath. It is important to provide safe showers for seniors. A nice choice is a shower with a very low or no threshold; this practical design would instead be gently sloped toward your drain to prevent flooding. Another option is a walk in tub. This is a nice option for those who particularly enjoy soaking in a bath.
<h3>Raising the Toilet</h3>
In bathrooms for the elderly, using the toilet presents a particularly difficult challenge. A quicker and less expensive option would be to use a removable seat with handles, these can be found at medical supply stores, or even online. If you are looking for a more inviting and permanent fix, you can install a toilet that is taller on its own.
<h3>Making the Vanity More Inviting</h3>
A bathroom remodel for seniors should include a seated vanity space which makes them feel comfortable and at ease, confident in their ability to care for themself. Designing an area around wheelchair accessibility, where styling and grooming tools are easily within reach is important. Also, consider a mounted mirror that is either movable or tilted downward from the wall so that it can be used while seated.
<h3>Bathing Solutions for the Elderly</h3>
When building showers for the elderly, there are several measures that can be taken to make bathing a more pleasant and worry-free experience. First, it is important to provide seating. A removable seat with handles can be purchased and used, but built in seating is even more convenient and easier to keep clean. Second, install easy to grip grab bars in multiple positions. It is important to remember to reinforce shower walls to ensure that they can withstand the weight of an adult. Third, look to make the showerhead as easy to access as possible.
<h3>Increasing Lighting</h3>
It is important to provide extra lighting for elderly individuals whom may be visually impaired. Make for several options of lighting such as night lights for the evening, or sky lights to bring in ample quantities of rejuvenating sunlight. Motion activated lights are great, especially for those who use walkers, canes, or wheelchairs.
<h3>Fall-Proofing the Floor</h3>
If your elderly loved one takes a fall, they are at risk of great injury. It is important for bathrooms for the elderly to have no-slip coating in the tub or shower, and plush mats on the floors to reduce the chance of a fall occuring.

A bathroom remodel for seniors might prove to be a rather large undertaking. However, you’ll gain peace of mind knowing the your elderly loved one has a safe place where they can have their independence.",,,1,315,"bathrooms for elderly",30,"[{""keyword"":""safe showers for seniors "",""score"":""ok""},{""keyword"":""bathroom remodel for seniors"",""score"":""ok""},{""keyword"":""bathing solutions for the elderly"",""score"":""ok""},{""keyword"":""showers for elderly"",""score"":""ok""}]",,,,"<div class=""et_pb_section et_pb_section_0 et_section_regular"">

					<p>A bathroom remodel for seniors is certainly a challenge, especially when it comes to your loved ones. Wheelchair or walker accessibility, space for assistance when it is needed, and choosing &#8216;arthritis-friendly&#8217; fixtures are just a few things to consider.<br />
Spacious Bathrooms for Older Adults<br />
Leaving enough space to maneuver a wheelchair to the shower, toilet, or vanity will save you a great deal of trouble in the end. If you choose to expand your bathroom space, it might require moving plumbing, or even breaking down and rebuilding walls. This is a big step, and you’ll want to do this first, and you might even consider hiring a professional contractor.<br />
Ensuring Wheelchair/Walker Accessibility<br />
Forcing a wheelchair or walker through an exceedingly narrow doorway can result in damage to the door jams, surrounding walls, and even your equipment or loved one. There is nothing simple about widening the entry to a room, and subsequently replacing the door. If you need only a couple of extra inches, swing away door hinges might be a simpler solution than renovating, and they can be found at most local hardware stores.<br />

3025,"10 Helpful Apps for Seniors","We are living in an age where technology drives the world. Seniors may not be the first or second ones to adjust to this digital era, yet they too live with the times. Over the past few years, smartphones have slowly replaced press keyboards, and contain numerous apps that can help seniors keep in touch with their loved ones. However, many of these apps may be too complex for the old people and due to this fact, we provide the ten best apps for seniors that could offer a great help and give them more reason to befriend technology.

3124,"8 Facts about Millennials vs Baby Boomers","You may have heard the term Millennial thrown around about this younger generation, especially as they establish themselves in the work force and make a political statement with the current world. However, there are a lot of misconceptions about this generation, especially how they view and interact with the older ones.

Social Media. This should come as no surprise that this generation is not only tech savvy, but completely at home online. Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube have become the standards for normal communication. However, Baby Boomers are increasing their online footprint, with 78% of them estimated to be “surfing.”

Media Availability. Coupled with the increase of social media access is the desire to use it and voice their opinions. They require usage of it even at the work place, in fact 56% will not work somewhere with limited or no access to it. Even more so, 71% of them will ignore work place policies restricting access, and believe that they can use it as a platform to critique their place of employment.

Student Debt. Another little known fact about Millennials is the staggering amount of debt they are carrying. With over 1 Trillion dollars $ of student loan debt alone, this generation is the most heavily indebted coming out of college. However, they also have a surprisingly high graduation rate with over 63% with a 4 year or Bachelor’s degree.

Living with ‘Mom.’ This is a two sides of the coin statement. One hand you have 15% of millennials living at home with their parents, and their Baby Boomer parents that are eating some of that cost. On the other hand you have the Baby Boomer parents who not only are financially stable enough to help out their offspring, but their children had to deal with a horrible job market and recession for a long time.

Different Demographics. Another change for the old versus the new is the change in the demographics. Baby Boomers are 73% Caucasian and that number has been steadily shifting to the current Millennials at 56% Caucasian.

Land vs Air. Ever heard the statement “Print is Dead!” Well so is the landline. Millennials are truly cutting the cord. Only 41% still have a land line (including the ones living with mom!), and that number is expected to still fall. Baby Boomers still see the landline as essential and won’t make the switch to all cellular all the time.

Ebooks. Ever heard the statement “Print is….” Yes in the point above! Its not fully dead, but between newspapers, bookstores, and even libraries finding increasingly shrinking reader base, the transition to digital is in full swing.

Attention Span. In an age where media, T.V., commercials, ads, and even our music bombards us for our attention, it’s pretty easy to understand why Millennials are so good at adapting to it. Even if there is no such thing as true multitasking Millennials are some of the best. Counter to that, is the increased focus and attention span the Baby Boomers have. They have developed their ability to a laser focus and will see the task all the way through.",,"2018-06-08 13:23:26",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=3124,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/millennials-vs-baby-boomers.jpg|https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/millenials-vs-baby-boomers.png,"Millennials vs Baby Boomers|millenials-vs-baby-boomers","Millennials Geration X Baby Boomers Road Signs 3d Illustration|",|,"Millennials vs Baby Boomers|millenials-vs-baby-boomers",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/millennials-vs-baby-boomers.jpg,,"Quick Thoughts",,"attention span|baby|baby boomer|baby boomer parents|baby boomers|boomer parents|ever heard|ever heard the statement|ever heard the statement print|generation|heard the statement|heard the statement print|living with mom|media|millennials|social media|statement|statement print|work|work place",,,,,,,77,,,"millennials vs baby boomers","8 Facts about Millennials vs Baby Boomers - Dr Alexis Abramson","Want to know more about Millennials vs Baby Boomers.You may have heard the term Millennial thrown around about this younger generation, especially as they establish themselves in the work force and make a political statement with the current world.",,,5625,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.3.1,hourly,,,,1,315,"millennials vs baby boomers",60,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",8-facts-about-millennials-vs-baby-boomers,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:55:52",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3173,"The Fountain of Youth – Telomeres 101","The science community has made huge strides toward increasing longevity, especially regarding chronic illnesses and many types of cancer. Telomeres are an important factor in the growing field of regenerative medicine. The Greek meaning for telomeres is “end cap,” and telomeres have been compared with the plastic tips on shoelaces, because they keep chromosome ends from fraying and sticking to each other, which will destroy or scramble an organism's genetic information. Like the rest of a chromosome, <a href=""http://longevity.about.com/od/researchandmedicine/p/telomeres.htm"">telomeres</a> are sequences of DNA - chains of chemical code that are made of four nucleic acid bases: G for guanine, A for adenine, T for thymine, and C for cytosine. When the telomere becomes too short, essential parts of the DNA can be damaged in the replication process. Scientists have discovered that cells stop replicating when telomeres are shorter. In humans, a cell replicates about 50 times before the telomeres become too short. This is called the Hayflick limit.

Researchers can use the length of a cell's telomeres to determine the cell's age and how many more times is will replicate. This is important in anti-aging research. When a cell stops replicating, it enters into a period of decline known as ""cell senescence,"" which is the cellular equivalent of aging, and can signal the onset of dementia, cancer and other illnesses. An enzyme named telomerase adds bases to the ends of telomeres and if we could utilize it to ""immortalize"" human cells, we may be able to mass produce cells for transplantation, including insulin-producing cells to cure diabetes, muscle cells for treating muscular dystrophy, cartilage cells for certain kinds of arthritis, and skin cells for healing severe burns and wounds. An unlimited supply of normal human cells grown in the laboratory would also help efforts to test new drugs and gene therapies.

Obviously, <a href=""http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/chromosomes/telomeres/"">telomeres are important in cancer</a> research since many cancers have shortened telomeres, including pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, and kidney. By measuring telomerase, it may possible to detect cancer by making cancer cells age and die. There also is some evidence linking shortened telomeres to Alzheimer disease, hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. In one experiment, researchers blocked telomerase activity in human breast and prostate cancer cells growing in the laboratory, prompting the tumor cells to die. But there are risks involved since locking telomerase could impair fertility, wound healing, and production of blood cells and immune system cells, so research remains ongoing, although there are some facilities now offering consumer services relating to telomeres. Always ask for references and check with your doctor prior to pursuing this innovative procedure, as not all tests are considered reliable, and some can’t provide the critical data relating to actual telomere lengths.

Dolly the sheep had chromosomes with shorter telomeres probably because she was cloned from an adult mammary gland cell, which may have contributed to Dolly’s illnesses. Embryonic stem cells, however, express telomerase and are able to maintain their telomere lengths despite numerous cell divisions. A reprogramming of mature adult skin cells has been achieved with introduction of just a few defined nuclear factors. During the process of reverting cells to a more immature state, the reprogrammed cells’ telomeres are highly elongated. In the first steps of reprogramming and likely in the early stages of embryogenesis, cells can elongate, and thus “rejuvenate,” their telomeres.

There is still much to be learned about how telomerase gene mutations cause disease, why they only affect certain organs, and how telomeres can be targeted for therapies. Drugs or hormones that might modulate telomerase expression and maintain or elongate telomeres would be groundbreaking in the treatment of conditions in which telomere display obvious medical consequences. Whether telomere shortening mediates human aging—and whether telomere elongation may reverse aging or prevent age-related diseases—are still controversial issues.
<h3><a name=""_Toc406136300""></a>Energy/Rejuvenation</h3>
We’ve all had days when we feel run down, both mentally and physically. Your energy levels may spike at certain times and can be affected by your hydration levels, what you ate recently, and the amount of beneficial sleep you’ve had over the past few days. Hormones spikes and deficiencies can also contribute to a chronic, run-down feeling. Less than ideal levels of thyroid, testosterone and estrogen are associated with a sluggish feeling and should be discussed with your doctor. <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/thyroid-disease/expert-answers/FAQ-20058228"">Thyroid disease</a> can affect your mood and cause anxiety or depression. Generally, the more severe the thyroid disease, the more severe the mood changes. Hyperthyroidism is caused by an overactive thyroid and can cause restlessness, anxiety, irritability and nervousness. On the other hand, an underactive thyroid can exacerbate fatigue and depression.

Emotional symptoms alone don’t usually indicate thyroid disease. Other indicators associated with the disease include:
<ul>
 	<li>Weight gain or loss</li>
 	<li>Sensitivity to hot or cold</li>
 	<li>Bowel movement changes</li>
 	<li>Menstrual irregularities</li>
</ul>
You doctor can order a simple blood workup to determine if you need medication to block your body's ability to produce new thyroid hormone or to replace missing thyroid hormone. In either case, the correct thyroid diagnosis usually improves both emotional and physical symptoms.

Although several high-profile studies have proven there are some risks associated with hormone therapy, the <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/ART-20046372"">Mayo Clinic</a> has shared the recent results of a Danish 10 year study of treatment, in which women receiving hormone replacement therapy early after menopause had a significantly reduced risk of mortality, heart failure or heart attack, without any apparent increase in risk of cancer or stroke. Your age, type of menopause and time since menopause play a significant role in the risks associated with hormone therapy. Speak with your doctor to assess your personal risks.

Shake off bouts of depression or low energy by recharging your batteries with some deep breathing exercises and physical activity. Tap into your inner bliss by practicing <a href=""http://www.how-to-meditate.org/"">meditation</a> techniques that are beneficial for anyone experiencing anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and physical symptoms related to stress or disease. Meditation can sooth mood fluctuations that arise through stress or external elements by creating an inner space of clarity that enables you to control your mind and nurture your compassionate nature.

Explore the benefits of <a href=""http://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/explore-healing-practices/reflexology"">reflexology</a> and <a href=""http://acupressure.com/"">acupressure</a>, based on ancient healing techniques that work by applying direct pressure to <a href=""http://www.acupressure.com/articles/acupuncture_and_acupressure_points.htm"">acupressure points</a>. Reflexology focuses specifically on areas at the bottom of your feet, inside the palms of your hands and your ears to deliver therapeutic massage to corresponding organs, bones and systems throughout the body. Stimulating these points will increase blood flow and relax the nervous system, while reducing stress to enhance your rejuvenation. <a href=""http://www.yogabasics.com/"">Yoga</a> is mentioned several times in this chapter and remains on the short list as a sensible way to recharge and rejuvenate by helping to increase your energy levels and as a fun way to tap into your mind-body connection. I recently heard an amazing story of a woman in her 50’s who was trying to beat a long-term addiction to anti-depression medications. Her overall health and vitality was not up to par and it soon became obvious, after speaking with her doctor, that the medication was a contributing factor to her overall health decline. She opted to wean herself off the meds over the course of several weeks, and decided to try a yoga class at the suggestion of a friend. After just six months, she has managed to eliminate her need for anti-depressants altogether and has made yoga and meditation a regular part of her life. Obviously, this is a life-changing scenario that took will power and determination on her part, but the benefits will last a lifetime.

You might want to explore other healing art techniques, such as <a href=""http://www.nianow.com/practice"">Nia</a>, a national network of certified instructors that combines goal setting, martial arts, dance arts and healing arts in sensory-based exercises that encourage you to move at your own pace.

If a change in scenery is what your inner, feel-good doctor prescribes, locate a rejuvenating spa or resort to give yourself a makeover that begins on the inside. Uplift your spirits with meditative sessions and group or individual therapy designed to lighten your mental load. Spas that offer massage therapy and practice the healing arts of Eastern cultures focus on the <em>mind-body-spirit </em>connection as part of their curriculum. Before subscribing to a specific regime or facility, do your homework by asking for a list of referrals or check out their client satisfaction standing. As always, get your doctors approval prior to making a major change in your diet or exercise routine.

It’s never too late to re-charge diminished energy levels. If you’ve used your age as an excuse not to exercise, it’s important that you overcome the self-imposed, mental stigma and begin with some basic movements to get the blood flowing. March in place, do some deep knee bends and rotate your arms in a full circle for a few minutes at a time if you’ve not had much physical activity lately. The important thing is to get up and move and include deep cleansing breaths to enhance blood flow. Many people decide to <a href=""http://www.bluezones.com/programs/blue-zones-communities/blue-zones-project-in-iowa/"">walk their way to health</a> and create community participation along the way by inviting others to join in the invigorating activity.

If your need more inspiration, consider the late-in-life accomplishments of the 100-year-old Indian man named <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049994/Fauja-Singh-100-smashes-world-record-oldest-marathon-runner.html"">Fauja Singh</a>, who set the world record as the oldest marathon runner when he completed the 26 mile Toronto race in 8 hours and 25 minutes. Fauja didn’t even begin running until his mid-sixties - out of boredom, and maintained a robust habit of running ten miles on a regular basis until the age of 100. He credits his endurance to remaining happy and stress free, as well as his simple, Indian-based diet that includes native teas and spices.

3176,"The 2nd Act in Retirement","Retirement is a transition that comes with mixed emotions. You may feel like you’ve finally reached your professional stride and still have some productive years left, but the human resources department is suggesting you take a less-demanding position based on the results of your annual physical and length of time with the company. And then there’s the obvious choice – leaving the active job market altogether. There’s much to consider before making a permanent change in your employment status, including setting some new goals for your future and making sure you have the funds to achieve them. Much like plotting an exciting, roadway adventure - retirement also requires planning, especially at transition stages when you are scrambling for answers.

If you haven’t done the math yet, make sure it’s part of your big equation. One <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/downside-early-retirement-153836458.html"">downside of Early Retirement</a> is that a lot of people <em>don't</em> do the math. “A good rule of thumb is: If you can't pay off your mortgage, you can't afford to retire,” according to Tom Sightings, a former publishing executive who was eased into early retirement in his mid-50s. He lives in the New York area and blogs at <a href=""http://sightingsat60.blogspot.com/"">Sightings at 60</a>, where he covers health, finance, retirement and other concerns of Baby Boomers who realize that somehow they have grown up.

<a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/silver_lining/2011/03/dont_stop_working.html"">Don't stop working</a> may be the mantra that keeps you alive longer, and not just for the money. Consider that <em>The Longevity Project</em>, by psychology professors Howard S. Friedman and Leslie R. Martin, presents the end-of-life findings with surprising conclusions about the factors that sustain a long, rewarding life. For those who contemplate retirement as decades filled with leisure and relaxation, “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594630755/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594630755#reader_1594630755"">The Longevity Project</a><em>” </em>serves as a warning. As Friedman says, ""fun can be overrated and stress can be unfairly blamed.”

Perhaps a smarter way to approach the on-set of retirement is to transition into a softer job that provides a meaningful reason to get out of bed in the morning. Seek to parlay your expertise into an advisory position or pursue a free-lance job that keeps you in control of the time clock. If you’re approaching retirement, take advantage of the pause in your career to define your wants and needs if you still want to remain active in the workforce. <em>Use it or lose it</em> may very well be true when it comes to exercising your mind’s cognitive skills, but there’s another, more compelling reason why seniors should stay mentally-engaged throughout their retirement.

An interesting finding in a recent <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/old-people-memory-study_n_4639738.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009"">memory study</a> sites a new study from Germany that has likened the memory abilities of older people to full hard drives: “<em>They don’t lose cognitive power over time; they just function slower because of an increasing amount of information.”</em>

""The human brain works slower in old age but only because we have stored more information over time,"" lead researcher from Tübingen University in Germany, Dr. Michael Ramscar, said in the Huffington Post article.

The team of researchers used computers to replicate different stages of an adult’s memory recall. The computer models were fed small amounts of information each day and as the devices gathered more data, their performances mirrored those of older people, according to the study, which was published this month in the journal Topics in Cognitive Science.

""Forget about forgetting,"" study researcher Peter Hendrix told The Independent. ""If I wanted to get the computer to look like an older adult, I had to keep all the words it learned in memory and let them compete for attention.""

So unless you’re prepared to give up your claim in the game of life, stay engaged in either a fun job or challenging and meaningful pursuit to stay sharp and ready for the adventures that await in the 2<sup>nd</sup> act of your retirement, whatever you decide it should be.

While you’re weighing your options, why not consider doing something for the sheer joy it brings? Consider offbeat choices, such as poising for portraits with kids as the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus, or perhaps conducting guided tours for a museum or historical attraction that you enjoy visiting. The rules and criteria that once defined your professional career may no longer exist, thereby clearing the way for something else completely different. For instance, imagine the kick that a <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/31/american-apparel-model-_n_4701743.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009"">62 year old model</a> gets out of knowing she still has what it takes to generate consumer interest in underwear. Expect to see more senior spokespersons in the media, as the shift to target the incoming sixty-something age group increases.

A promising future of <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/baby-boomer-busines/"">entrepreneurship for Baby Boomers</a> is also on the drawing board since many don’t know when to quit, and because they are at the pulse point of knowing how to match the needs of fellow Boomers with their own and what it takes to meet those demands after years of doing it for someone else. Rising stars in Boomer-based businesses include specialize services in the fields of technology, health care, education, and much more.

3181,"Benefits of Giving Your ""Time""","Why does early retirement continue to be linked to earlier death? The most obvious reason is those retiring earlier may be less healthy than older retirees. Personality type also plays a role. People who have low self-control, low persistence and failure to do long-term planning, have a higher mortality after retirement.

On the other hand, those who volunteer after they retire are more likely to live longer, according to research conducted in Italy and reported by the <a href=""http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/senior-focus-retirement-could-be-bad-for-your-health/article_80179bac-353d-5a29-8127-f4d86432b650.html"">St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Senior Focus</a> . A fixable factor for early death after retirement was loneliness. The article, written by Dr. John Morley, St. Louis University School of Medicine, emphasizes the importance of staying connected to others. Helping others that are less fortunate can instill and develop an empathetic attitude, which is a necessary part of staying connected and reducing stress levels caused by excessive loneliness. Identify charities that speak to your heart and volunteer your time or talents to bring joy into someone else’s life. The feel-good endorphins promote lower blood pressure and higher energy levels.

According to the book, “<a href=""http://longevityrules.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-age-of-longevity.html"">Longevity Rules</a>,” our choices are a reflection of who we really are. The collaborative book project goes even further to suggest that when it comes to human beings, the capacity to teach and share wisdom and other skills are just as important as the capacity to reproduce.

Giving of your time is a natural aspect of aging since wisdom is generally associated with the experience that comes from living a long life. Altruistic actions are often the result of past experiences, emotional intelligence, and knowledge gained over the course of a lifetime that initiate and inspire our compassionate natures. To jump start your volunteer pursuits, focus on a specific charity that is important to you, or one that advocates research for a specific illness that may have claimed the life of a loved one.

Perhaps you prefer to mentor young children by volunteering to read during story time at a local library, school or day care. If you have a soft spot for animals, donate a few hours a week to an animal shelter. There is no shortage of worthy causes that can benefit from your donation of time and experience. Local chapters of national organizations, such as <a href=""http://www.kiwanis.org/kiwanisone"">Kiwanis</a> Club or the <a href=""http://bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx"">Boys and Girls Club</a> of America are all about giving and sharing your time. Although flashing an impressive resume might get you a job, in the world of volunteering, it’s your physical presence that really matters. If you have a teaching or counseling background, there will be no shortage of volunteer positions to choose from. By availing yourself to new opportunities within the heart of your community, you will receive invaluable and infinite rewards in return.

Draw from the pool of valuable assets you possess as a result of your lifelong profession. Parlay your wisdom into a mentoring tool to seek out organizations within your field of expertise that match young entrepreneurs with retired professionals. Sharing acquired knowledge and experience not only helps younger generations, but it also renews validation of your professional worth. Local colleges, universities, hospitals and community centers are also good sources of information when seeking out potential mentoring and volunteering assignments.

Consider a compassionate career, in which volunteerism is the only criteria. In Canada, there is a term called <a href=""http://internal-communication.com/miserable_worke/"">“Zenployment</a>,” which has caught on and refers to any kind of work, including self-employment that you choose after you retire from your regular career, with the goal aimed at making a difference. The surprising trend has caught on with large numbers of dissatisfied professionals dedicating at least a portion of their productive years to a meaningful cause. Starting in their mid-thirties, many professionals are choosing to dedicate time to be of service in a second career that offers fulfilment and the chance to make a difference by the age of 45.

A 2013 report published in the journal Psychology and Aging did a comprehensive analysis on previous studies that focused on the <a href=""http://longevity.about.com/od/lifelongrelationships/a/Volunteering-And-Longevity.htm"">health benefits of volunteerism</a>. Researchers from Arizona State University and the University of Michigan were clearly able to cite instances where volunteering was proven to boost satisfaction in relationships, and reduced stress levels in tested subjects. In addition, subjects who had become recently widowed were shown to recover faster from depression by volunteering.

<a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/money/retirement-planning/after-retirement/overview/after-retirement.htm"">Volunteering after retirement</a> gives you the opportunity to explore new fields of interest and pursue your passions. Decide which skills you would like to develop and contact businesses or organizations that fit the bill to offer apprenticing services or other useful skills. For instance, offer to assist with patient registration at a local vet’s office if you have a love for animals.

Without the stress of having to bring home the bacon, you may tap into a reserve of talent and skills that have been waiting patiently to be explored with ease. Time is on your side when it comes to sharing it.

3182,"Benefits of Giving Your ""Time""","Why does early retirement continue to be linked to earlier death? The most obvious reason is those retiring earlier may be less healthy than older retirees. Personality type also plays a role. People who have low self-control, low persistence and failure to do long-term planning, have a higher mortality after retirement.

On the other hand, those who volunteer after they retire are more likely to live longer, according to research conducted in Italy and reported by the <a href=""http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/senior-focus-retirement-could-be-bad-for-your-health/article_80179bac-353d-5a29-8127-f4d86432b650.html"">St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Senior Focus</a> . A fixable factor for early death after retirement was loneliness. The article, written by Dr. John Morley, St. Louis University School of Medicine, emphasizes the importance of staying connected to others. Helping others that are less fortunate can instill and develop an empathetic attitude, which is a necessary part of staying connected and reducing stress levels caused by excessive loneliness. Identify charities that speak to your heart and volunteer your time or talents to bring joy into someone else’s life. The feel-good endorphins promote lower blood pressure and higher energy levels.

According to the book, “<a href=""http://longevityrules.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-age-of-longevity.html"">Longevity Rules</a>,” our choices are a reflection of who we really are. The collaborative book project goes even further to suggest that when it comes to human beings, the capacity to teach and share wisdom and other skills are just as important as the capacity to reproduce.

Giving of your time is a natural aspect of aging since wisdom is generally associated with the experience that comes from living a long life. Altruistic actions are often the result of past experiences, emotional intelligence, and knowledge gained over the course of a lifetime that initiate and inspire our compassionate natures. To jump start your volunteer pursuits, focus on a specific charity that is important to you, or one that advocates research for a specific illness that may have claimed the life of a loved one.

Perhaps you prefer to mentor young children by volunteering to read during story time at a local library, school or day care. If you have a soft spot for animals, donate a few hours a week to an animal shelter. There is no shortage of worthy causes that can benefit from your donation of time and experience. Local chapters of national organizations, such as <a href=""http://www.kiwanis.org/kiwanisone"">Kiwanis</a> Club or the <a href=""http://bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx"">Boys and Girls Club</a> of America are all about giving and sharing your time. Although flashing an impressive resume might get you a job, in the world of volunteering, it’s your physical presence that really matters. If you have a teaching or counseling background, there will be no shortage of volunteer positions to choose from. By availing yourself to new opportunities within the heart of your community, you will receive invaluable and infinite rewards in return.

Draw from the pool of valuable assets you possess as a result of your lifelong profession. Parlay your wisdom into a mentoring tool to seek out organizations within your field of expertise that match young entrepreneurs with retired professionals. Sharing acquired knowledge and experience not only helps younger generations, but it also renews validation of your professional worth. Local colleges, universities, hospitals and community centers are also good sources of information when seeking out potential mentoring and volunteering assignments.

Consider a compassionate career, in which volunteerism is the only criteria. In Canada, there is a term called <a href=""http://internal-communication.com/miserable_worke/"">“Zenployment</a>,” which has caught on and refers to any kind of work, including self-employment that you choose after you retire from your regular career, with the goal aimed at making a difference. The surprising trend has caught on with large numbers of dissatisfied professionals dedicating at least a portion of their productive years to a meaningful cause. Starting in their mid-thirties, many professionals are choosing to dedicate time to be of service in a second career that offers fulfilment and the chance to make a difference by the age of 45.

A 2013 report published in the journal Psychology and Aging did a comprehensive analysis on previous studies that focused on the <a href=""http://longevity.about.com/od/lifelongrelationships/a/Volunteering-And-Longevity.htm"">health benefits of volunteerism</a>. Researchers from Arizona State University and the University of Michigan were clearly able to cite instances where volunteering was proven to boost satisfaction in relationships, and reduced stress levels in tested subjects. In addition, subjects who had become recently widowed were shown to recover faster from depression by volunteering.

<a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/money/retirement-planning/after-retirement/overview/after-retirement.htm"">Volunteering after retirement</a> gives you the opportunity to explore new fields of interest and pursue your passions. Decide which skills you would like to develop and contact businesses or organizations that fit the bill to offer apprenticing services or other useful skills. For instance, offer to assist with patient registration at a local vet’s office if you have a love for animals.

Without the stress of having to bring home the bacon, you may tap into a reserve of talent and skills that have been waiting patiently to be explored with ease. Time is on your side when it comes to sharing it. The benefits you get back from volunteering are immeasurable and can include new friendships and acquaintances and increased mental stamina, to name just a few.

3186,"Close Friendships/Social Networks","We are all social creatures at heart. The simple act of good conversation with a close friend can offer acceptance, understanding, compassion and even an occasional wake-up call when necessary. Those who regularly interact with their friends and peers are often the happiest and the healthiest, especially when social connections are maintained and preserved over the course of a lifetime.

A study in the journal, “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences” showed that older people who are happy have a 35 percent lower risk of dying over a five-year period than unhappy people. That study included 3,853 people ages 52 to 79. Additionally, it is believed that <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/29/optimism-longer-life-longevity-genes-personality_n_1553967.html"">personality is tied to life span</a><u>.</u>

“Happiness could be a marker of some other aspect of people's lives which is particularly important for health,"" study researcher Andrew Steptoe, a professor at University College, London, told The Telegraph. ""For example, happiness is quite strongly linked to good social relationships, and maybe it is things like that that are accounting for the link between happiness and health.""<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/u01bmgIZr5w?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Social Networks provide an extra benefit toward extending age. According to “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594630755/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594630755#reader_1594630755"">The Longevity Project</a>,” those who have a large social network and good social relations, lived the longest. It was also revealed that those that enjoy helping others achieved even greater longevity when combined with good social relations.

In an article published in Psychology Today, entitled “<a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201305/social-connectivity-drives-the-engine-well-being"">Social Connectivity Drives the Engine</a>,” author, Christopher Bergland shares his findings. “There is a direct connection between social isolation, loneliness, and a potential downward spiral towards poor health.” John Cacioppo is a University of Chicago social psychologist and neuroscientist who studies the biological effects of loneliness. Cacioppo has found that loneliness is linked to dramatic increases in the stress hormone cortisol, hardening of the arteries (which leads to high blood pressure), inflammation in the body, and can diminish executive function, learning, and memory.

We are all require social connectivity to maintain good health and longevity. Although Facebook and other social media websites do provide a digital interface to our social contacts, it is important that we also make a conscious effort to nurture our human bonds and sense of community. It is the face-to-face contact and intimate human connections that engage our biological systems to preserve our well-being. Strive for every method of communication that keeps you connected and engaged with close friends through multiple forms of communication. Make use of the internet to stay in touch when physical interaction isn’t possible.

While you’re browsing your way through the web to post your latest photos or plot your next big adventure, consider using the resources at your disposal to stay abreast of your health. Apparently, there are proven benefits for older adults <a href=""http://www.seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Features/2013/20131022_Older%20Adults%20Using%20the%20Internet%20are%20More%20Likely%20to%20Engage%20in%20Cancer%20Prevention%20Behavior.htm"">using the internet</a> as a source of information to help prevent cancer and other diseases. A pro-active approach to your health can include keeping up-to-date on the latest medical advances and helping to assess your own health-related issues. Join health-oriented groups and frequent websites you trust to gain an on-going grasp of products, policies and the latest advances that can directly affect your health. Add your name to the membership list of the sites you are attracted to in order to network with others with similar life events and to stay updated on changes that most affect you. Discover the benefits of social networking by opening the door to mutual online acquaintances that can eventually lead to real friendships. Of course, exercise some common sense if you encounter someone with aggressive behavior or that doesn’t enhance your friendly side.

A new <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/journal/1538-7755_Cancer_Epidemiology_Biomarkers_amp_Prevention"">study</a> published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, collected data from men and women aged 50 or older and finds that those who use the internet are more likely to participate in screening for colorectal cancer, participate in physical activities, eat healthy, and smoke less, compared with those who do not use the internet.

To ensure your online experience is pleasant, opt out of any websites that request too much personal information, such as your driver’s license number, Social Security number, bank or credit card information. If you decide to let your fingers do the shopping online, make sure identity-theft security measures are in place before sharing your account numbers. Avoid using a debit card to make online purchases, as those charges are harder to contest if a purchase goes wrong or gets damaged or lost during delivery.

An on-line support system includes good friends and family, and is one of the perks of maintaining an on-line presence that didn’t even exist for most of us a decade ago. Make good use of the technology that keeps you connected to the ones that matter.

3189,"Aging and Alcohol Intake","Both drinkers and non-drinkers have varying opinions about the never-ending debate regarding alcohol’s long-term effects on the human body. A <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2017200,00.html#ixzz2ovLpwgFY"">TIME Article </a> entitled, “Why Do Heavy Drinkers Outlive Nondrinkers?,” states, “Moderate drinking, which is defined as one-to-three drinks per day, is associated with the lowest mortality rates in alcohol studies. Moderate alcohol use (<em>especially when the beverage of choice is red wine</em>) is thought to improve heart health, circulation and sociability.”

Moderation is definitely the key word to include alcohol in your diet, and it should be preceded by at least 8 - 16 ounces of water for hydration, based on your individual body weight. Alcohol is more easily processed when consumed with a meal. Weigh all the benefits of sipping a glass of wine with your dinner, which may include social interactions and eating at a slower pace, and consume only moderate amounts to relax blood vessels and raise the good cholesterol in your blood by approximately 5 percent. People who normally abstain from drinking and live a solitary life can benefit from sharing a toast or two at an occasional social function or family gathering that includes light-to-moderate alcohol consumption to enhance their social triggers.

Seek out the advice of a qualified professional if you regularly exceed the recommended alcohol intake for men of 4 units per day, which equates to approximately three regular bottles of standard 5% beer. Ten milliliters are the equivalent of one unit of alcohol. The recommended safe limit for men is 21 units of alcohol per week, with no more than 4 units a day. For women, the safe limit guideline is 14 units of alcohol per week and no more than 3 units a day is acceptable. Your body mass and general state of health should help determine whether that extra glass of wine is okay.

Chronic, excessive use of alcohol can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, inflammation of the pancreas gland, electrolyte disturbances, weight gain, nutritional deficiencies, damage to the nervous system, impaired concentration, elevated blood lipid levels, cardiomyopathy (swelling of the heart), cancer and a long list of psychiatric problems including depression and increased suicide risk.

Genetics or heredity plays a role in alcoholic liver disease in two ways: It may influence how much alcohol you consume and your likelihood of developing alcoholism. If someone in your family has suffered from alcoholism or if you recognize a drinking problem or an alcohol-related health issue, speak to your physician about treatment options and alternatives and seek counseling through local sources. If your lifestyle is conducive to popping the cork too often, make the necessary changes to implement restraint and extend your life.

Excessive alcohol intake can quickly reverse the benefits of moderation by reducing the vitamin absorption from nutrient-dense foods. Alcoholics and others that consume excessive amounts of alcohol can suffer from osteoporosis, gastrointestinal and liver distress. If fat makes up more than 5%-10% of the weight of your liver, you may have alcoholic liver disease (ALD), which can lead to serious complications. More than 15 million people in the U.S. abuse or overuse alcohol, and a shockingly-large amount - over 90%, develop fatty livers. And, it may also affect levels of liver enzymes involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of alcohol.

The ravages of lifelong heavy alcohol consumption on the human body may include permanent liver damage and obesity. If you’re overweight by more than 20 pounds, giving up the bottle may be the only way to avoid liver disease. A study by researchers from the Universities of Bristol and Glasgow tracked 9,000 men for an average of 29 years in Scotland to study the effects of alcohol consumption in relation to body mass index on liver disease. The smart approach would be to <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7421524/Reduce-safe-drinking-limits-for-overweight-people-research-suggests.html"">reduce safe drinking</a> limits of overweight people to extend their lives and to avoid potential liver cirrhosis. The study revealed that obese men who drank at least a pint of beer a day – had the greatest risk of liver disease – 19 times higher than average weight non-drinkers. Findings also indicate that overweight women double the risk of liver disease just by drinking two glasses of wine a day. And if your drink of choice is high on the <a href=""http://www.the-alcoholism-guide.org/alcohol-calorie-chart.html"">alcohol calorie chart</a>, opt for one that offers a lower calorie count.

Research continues to straddle the fence on alcohol’s long-term effects, so side with caution as you age and apply the common-sense logic that tells you when to back away from the bar. Your body mass index, general state of health, medication interactions and food intake combine with alcohol to stir your nightly cocktail. It’s particularly important to realize that if your medication dosage or body chemistry has undergone a change, you alcohol consumption should follow suite. Re-evaluate your alcohol intake and review all drug and alcohol interaction advisories or discuss your specific concerns with your pharmacist or physician on a regular basis. Opt to drink a higher volume of water prior to imbibing in more than one serving to minimize the effects of alcohol absorption.

Before you decide to add alcohol to your next meal, <a href=""http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/check-the-facts/what-is-alcohol/types-of-alcohol/wine"">get the facts</a> about how much and which type of alcohol you should avoid. Check your wine's ABV (alcohol by volume) to track how strong it is and what percentage of the drink is made up of alcohol. For example, wine with 12% ABV is 12% pure alcohol. Avoid wines with a high ABV percentage of 18% or more to minimize the negative impacts of alcohol in your system.",,"2020-05-06 18:32:24",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/aging-and-alcohol-intake/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/baby_boomer_drinking.jpg,baby_boomer_drinking,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/baby_boomer_drinking.jpg,,Caregiving|Longevity,,"4 units|alcohol consumption|alcohol intake|alcohol's long-term|alcohol's long-term effects|alcoholic liver disease|body mass|body mass index|effects of alcohol|general state|general state of health|glass of wine|liver|liver disease|mass index|risk of liver|risk of liver disease|safe limit|state of health|units of alcohol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3190,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-06-24|2018-05-20|2018-05-06,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.3.1,hourly,,,,1,42,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",aging-and-alcohol-intake,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:57:37",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3192,"Empty Nest Syndrome","Give yourself time to adjust to living alone after previously sharing your home with a spouse, kids or loved ones. You may find the perks of staying up late, controlling the remote, and eating all your favorite foods more appealing than you ever thought possible, especially if you haven’t had much <strong><em>me time</em></strong>. Living alone has hidden benefits, including giving yourself permission to do as you please!

There’s a good chance your solitude won’t last forever - <em>so enjoy the peace and quiet while you can.</em> Children that leave home for the first time rely on the unspoken rule that allows them to return to the nest if a lack of suitable employment and/or living arrangements become an issue - Gerontologists call that the <strong>failure to launch</strong>!!! No one wants to see a child suffer through the hardship of a failed marriage, break-up or job loss, especially since they often run back home, even if only to temporarily repair a broken heart, or regroup their career goals. It’s rare - these days - for a child leaving home for the first time to never look back, much less - never return to the family nest. This trend has picked up steam because of recent economic downturns that sends the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robi-ludwig/how-long-is-too-long_b_3748365.html"">boomerang generation</a> back home with increasing regularity. State your intentions about future house rules, especially if you would rather your home didn’t have a revolving door. Clarify changes that you would like to initiate in the event of returning offspring, including cleaning standards, contributions for housing expenses and curfew rules. Weigh the advantages of living alone against the benefits of welcoming a returning relative back to the nest before making a spontaneous decision.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dn9b5w-FpOo?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

While the nest is empty, re-evaluate the good and bad points of living alone in your present home and weigh-in on all factors, including finances, security concerns, cleaning demands and regular home maintenance, to identify potential bumps in the road. An older, large home that was ideal to raise a family of four may have evolved into a high-maintenance money pit that will deplete your savings and a large amount of your time and energy. Aging bones don’t belong on tall ladders or rooftops, so factor in maintenance and labor costs when deciding whether to stay put in the family nest. Certainly nostalgia will play a part in the decision whether to move on, but I believe it should never be the <em>determining</em> factor.

If you do decide to stay put, evaluate your home’s space and adapt it to suit your favorite activities and hobbies. For instance, turn an empty bedroom into a multi-purpose media room and fitness center and include some of your favorite music and videos to inspire and energize you through daily workouts.

If you're transitioning to single life for the first time, implement beefed-up security measures, such as a monitored home alarm service that includes a personal monitoring or security device with a panic button to summon instant help in the event of an emergency. Check locks on exterior doors and windows and make use of outdoor lighting to illuminate a dark porch, pathway or driveway. “<em>Don’t speak to strangers”</em> takes on a whole new meaning when living alone. When in doubt, don’t answer the door. If you feel threatened, call a neighbor or the local authorities for immediate assistance. Privacy, safety and security should always be a top priority when you’re living by yourself.

And by the way… being alone doesn’t have to result in your <em>being lonely</em>. Stay in touch with family and friends by arranging regular visits and phone calls. If your kids live fast-paced lives with tight schedules, offer to cook or arrange for a healthy takeout menu to ease their workload during the middle of a busy week. Grandkids and great-grandkids always enjoy a visit to their grandparent’s home, so make sure time is allocated or extend an open invitation for a visit.

To ease solitary life, extend your love and the comforts of your home to a pet companion. <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/200906/the-health-and-psychological-benefits-bonding-pet-dog"">Pet bonding</a> offers psychological and health benefits since pets have been known to reduce bouts of depression for those that live alone. In fact, recent research revealed pet owners had lower levels of blood pressure and cholesterol than non-pet-owners, even in instances involving those owners who smoked and/or had high-fat diets. The benefits extend well beyond the time that the pet is in the room with you. Tap into your compassionate nature to experience the joys of sharing your life with your new best friend.

Incidentally, it’s even been proven beneficial if you just hang out with the neighbor’s dog. The study also showed that positive psychological effects occurred after interacting with a dog for just 5 to 24 minutes, which is much faster than the drugs that are often taken to relieve stress. Just as an aside, if you are at all hearing impaired you may find comfort in knowing that another set of ears is always on guard for knocks at the door or unusual noises.

If a four-footed friend is out of the question, consider the benefits of owning a bird or starting an aquarium with a few tropical fish. But before pursuing the joys of pet ownership, designate one or more pet caregivers that you can rely on for those times when you are unable to care for your pet, especially if you travel regularly. I suggest that if you’re prone to isolation, avoid using pet ownership as a crutch to remain in seclusion or unavailable for friends and family get-togethers and out-of-town invitations. Seek out boarding kennels as an alternative to ensure you’re available for any outings, travels and adventures that you would otherwise attend.

Take advantage of your freedom and independence by pursuing activities and special-interest groups that cater to your talents or aspirations, such as a local photography club or a Thai cooking class. An empty nest also provides a good reason to take an extended vacation or visit with out-of-town friends and family.

3197,"Do Rich People Really Live Longer?","The connection between wealth and longevity may be easy to track. There is a residual effect, such as access to better health care, which can include preventive maintenance, like regular checkups and monitoring, resulting in informed lifestyle choices.

Statistics from the <a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/g/correlation.aspx?v1=67&amp;v2=30&amp;y=2003"">Mundi Index</a> places high-earning per capita as one of the primary indicators to long life, with Luxemburg leading the globe in both earnings and longevity. However, Andorra still leads the entire world in longevity, as the United States ranks with Norway in terms of GDP. However, life expectancy in Norway is averaged at 83.6 years as compared to 82.2 for the United States, which could be attributed to higher elevation or other factors.

Jay Leno has been estimated to earn an extra $20 million a year from touring and has said he will likely continue doing live shows in the coming years. Retirement may not be in his vocabulary, since he’s so eager to continue on his journey toward longevity. Leno shares his witty insights on stepping down from the throne after 22 successful years as the host of NBC’s, “The Tonight Show” through an article for Huffington Post entitled <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ann-brenoff/jay-leno-retiring_b_4674206.html?ref=topbar"">Jay Leno: Sticking His Landing</a>. Here are some lessons Boomers who are staring down the retirement clock can learn from Leno:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Be ready to sing your swan song with dignity</em>. Leno is a class act. He had nothing but nice things to say about Fallon, who replaced him. And even though he unseated Conan O'Brien when he reclaimed the late-night slot, it was because NBC begged Leno to take his old job back in 2010.</li>
 	<li><em>Indeed, eventually everyone gets screwed. </em> Be prepared for your exit with enough money squirreled away. Everyone reaches the end, and there's no point in denying it is coming or not preparing for it.</li>
 	<li><em>Going out on top feels a whole lot better than being shown the door. </em>In the 2013 May's sweeps, Leno was No. 1 on the late-night heap and drawing some of his best ratings in months.</li>
 	<li><em>It's fine to act your age</em>. Why pretend to be something you aren't? You don’t have to prove anything to anyone but yourself.</li>
</ul>
Although most of us can’t identify with Jay Leno’s lifestyle, we can still appreciate his style. He could easily opt for the limelight and spend the rest of his years resting on his laurels or going on adventurous road trips in an endless quest for antique car auctions to satisfy his well-documented passion. It certainly can’t be about the money. Instead, he has chosen the high road in the race to 100 and will continue to serve as a reminder that going out on top often means never really stopping. No doubt, his health, wealth and general well-being will continue to rise along with his star of fame.

To explore the relationship between wealth and long life further, it would be helpful to ask yourself the million dollar question: <em>What are my assets?</em>

Before answering, consider the wealth that can be found in non-monetary items as well as your stock portfolio and nest egg. Do you perceive the value of loyal friendships, a loving spouse and a caring family as part of your estate? Certainly you appreciate the worth of professional skills, talents, and even a good sense of humor. It’s easy to lose sight of the true riches that come with inheriting the earth. When you take stock of intangible valuables, such as a kind heart and a nurturing attitude, you begin to appreciate the vast wealth that can be accumulated throughout your lifetime, and which ones will stay with you throughout your life.

There are many cultures that place financial gain low on the totem pole of life. The traditional cultures of places like Vilcabamba, Andorra and Abkhasia embrace simple lifestyles, while placing financial status as a medium-to-low priority on their list, and yet they lead the race in both quality and quantity of life.

Even if you’re not in Jay Leno’s league, you can still create your own winning combination of wealth-building tools while investing in your personal stock of the assets you want to be most remembered for - <em>long after your race is over</em>.
<h3><a name=""_Toc406136307""></a>Why Retirement Is Different Today</h3>
Longevity upticks are achievable goals for both women and men that aim higher toward the 90-something mark after decades of living healthy into your 80’s. Preventive healthcare and routine maintenance are offshoots of the Baby Boomer generation. Self-monitoring devices, medical advances, and the growing acceptance of regular home health care assistance keeps seniors functioning at comfortable levels with greater efficiency.

Across-the-board improvements have boosted the average retirement age higher over the decades, thanks to the vigilance of the aging population. Good lifestyle choices carry us through the aging process granting extra years to achieve our financial and personal goals.

Governments systems struggle to maintain pension funds, and many are forced to raise the standards of retirement age. Like many other countries, France has also raised the retirement age from 60 to 62 years. Rules in place in Greece’s economy, such as those providing very early retirement to workers in hazardous jobs as well as to hundreds of thousands of public employees, coupled with Greece’s other current economic woes, threaten to bring down the whole system. The fact that people are working longer, often stems from a desire to keep active, and that helps to keep the Social Security fund in good economic health. As a result, the standard age of retirement in America has been going up.

The passage of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) in 1967, put the decision process in the hands of employees, by ensuring employers can’t force retirement before the age 65, and in 1986, mandatory retirement was eliminated for most occupations. Now you can work as long as you want, assuming the jobs are there and you are able to do the work. Employers can’t force you to retire just because of your age; however, they need not retain you either.

Hitting the retirement age mark while continuing to work gives you options to plot a specific course for your future while remaining active and earning extra funding for your long-range goals. Knowing that you are there by choice can evoke a sense of respect and admiration among co-workers and may help inspire their own work ethics. Working on the plus side of benefits often increases the quality of life and raises your integrity in the workplace.

However, seniors that hang on to their jobs should really adapt a love-it-or-leave-it approach. If you’ve dedicated a large portion of your career to one employer, you may find some co-workers eager to toast your departure, especially if your delayed exit slows down their own promotions and career plans. Although we have the right to work longer, we also have the responsibility of ensuring that we’re still up for the rigors of a demanding career. Ask yourself the tough questions when contemplating delayed retirement, including a truthful evaluation of your professional stamina. If your job is physically or mentally demanding, make sure you save enough kindling to ignite your own fires after retirement. A depleted body or a stressed-out mental state should not be part of your retirement plan. Consider a less-demanding job if you must continue to earn income and research the possibility of activating your Social Security benefits to supplement any reduced pay, if necessary. You may be able to continue working while claiming Social Security, but be aware of limitations regarding early-benefit activation and your break-even point, as discussed earlier in this chapter.

To make the right decision about the date of your final paycheck or when to activate your benefits, consult a financial advisor with experience in asset and wealth management. You can also do an on-line retirement gauge check-up to see if you are on target with your financial goals.

3200,"Tips When You Travel","In the quest for a meaningful life, consider a variety of worthwhile adventures that focus on broadening your perspective toward the aging process. A trip to Greece or Andorra may be the inspiration you need to coax a healthier lifestyle approach.

Speaking of Greece, consider adapting a philosophic approach to discovering authentic ways of aging. In the book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Travels-Epicurus-Journey-Island-Fulfilled/dp/0143121936"">Travels with Epicurus</a>, author Daniel Klein gives us an overview of some famous Greek philosophers’ thoughts on aging, while injecting some of his own insights. Klein states that “old age is a privilege to be savored, rather than a disease to be cured or a condition to be denied.”

Plato surmised that “<em>Life should be lived like a play</em>”…since…“<em>Man is God’s plaything</em>.” Klein sums up the criteria necessary to craft a meaningful old age and agrees with Plato about not taking life too seriously, but also feels it is important to reflect on your life and realize the value of your own history. He also cites benefits from the enjoyment of spending quality time with family, and unplugging the clock to overcome the fear of running out of time, as helpful ways to live out a meaningful life.

If you would rather not venture too far from home, revel in the excitement of spontaneous adventures where you and a loved one or a couple of close friends pack an overnight bag and hit the road on a quest to hear a good blues band. Adventures that are pre-planned can be just as enjoyable, with stopping points that appeal to your particular interest, such as Civil War landmarks and re-enactments or celestial stargazing events. Take advantage of online search engines to connect with others that enjoy the same interests and by joining local and regional clubs.

Plan a trip to the mountains since <a href=""http://dalje.com/en-lifestyle/high-altitudes-may-increase-longevity/348197"">high altitudes promote long life</a><u>.</u> A study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found the top 20 counties with the highest life expectancy were in Colorado and Utah with an average mean elevation of 5,967 feet above sea level. Lower oxygen levels turn on certain genes and the study suggests those genes may change the way heart muscles function. New blood vessels form as a result of lower oxygen levels, which creates new pathways for blood flow into the heart. If living in a lower oxygen environment that prevails in high altitudes helps reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, it could lead the way to new clinical treatments that address those conditions.

Extreme challenges, such as snow skiing and mountain-climbing are worthy activities for high altitudes. If you’re new to the sport, seek out a qualified instructor and get your doctor’s approval first. Stretch the boundaries beyond your usual comfort zone to explore your potential wanderlust. Consider signing up with a travel companion or two for a cruise or destination catering to senior citizens to enjoy the perks of traveling with your peers. Explore the benefit of rejuvenation by scheduling a trip to a luxury spa or retreat which caters to your specific interests, such as herbal wraps, a Mediterranean diet menu, and detoxifying body treatments.

Adventure is all about excitement. A cross-country train trip or leisurely camping excursion might be just the ticket for keeping pace, yet slightly removed from the mainstream population. Buddy-up with a close relative or good friend or consider joining a travel club, such as <a href=""http://www.eldertreks.com/"">Eldertreks,</a> to spread your wings even further.

Travel can be expensive – <em>or not</em>! Depending on the specifics of your travel plans, costs associated with wanderlust can be minimized by planning ahead. US News and World Report offers these <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/on-retirement/2010/11/01/5-tips-for-affordable-travel-in-retirement"">tips for affordable travel</a> that can apply to retirees or anyone that is hoping to travel economically.

<strong><em>Travel like an old pro:</em></strong><strong> <em>slow</em>.</strong> Retirees have more time to plan and shop around to take advantage of off-season discounts and travel dates that have lower fare prices and fewer crowds, such as cruises and sight-seeing tours.

<strong><em>Shop around for discounts and deals</em></strong><em>.</em> Seniors can benefit from extra discounts that may not be publicized regularly. Sign up for email alerts to receive information on the latest travel deals from your preferred airlines and hotels and take advantage of free air mile offers. Let your fingers to the research to get your best deals.

<strong><em>Consider taking a full-time job with travel options</em></strong><em>.</em> Search for a consulting job that sends you packing. Take advantage of the travel costs incurred by the company and extend the trip to explore new sites and nearby attractions.

Seniors have specific criteria when it comes to traveling. Here are a few general safety travel tips for Retirees from the <a href=""http://retirement-cafe.com/Retirement-Travel.html"">Retirement Cafe</a>:
<ul>
 	<li>Leave the good jewelry at home.</li>
 	<li>Confirm your travel plans and reservations before leaving home.</li>
 	<li>Put your address both inside and outside of your luggage.</li>
 	<li>Scrutinize hotel and restaurant bills, especially when traveling.</li>
 	<li>Keep valuable documents and items inside carry-on luggage and in your possession.</li>
 	<li>Opt for less-expensive luggage to downplay your social or financial status, especially when travelling abroad.</li>
 	<li>Regardless of how far you go, the degree to which your next trek turns out to be pleasurable, adventurous, and satisfying will depend on how well you plan your trip.</li>
 	<li>The quality of your journey will also depend on your ability to be spontaneous and how well you are able to maintain a positive attitude throughout.</li>
</ul>
Travel is a great way to re-ignite your inner-spark and expand your horizons. Seeing new places, learning about other cultures, and meeting new people opens your mind to possibilities. The splendor of exploring one-of-a-kind places like the Grand Canyon or going on a European railway adventure can enhance your life with a fresh thirst for adventure.",,"2020-01-10 19:53:33",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/tips-when-you-travel/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000367521465.jpg,nintchdbpict000367521465,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000367521465.jpg,,Longevity,,"advantage|adventures|aging|altitudes|consider|high altitudes|home|klein|life|lower oxygen|lower oxygen levels|meaningful|meaningful life|old age|oxygen levels|plan|time|travel|travel plans|trip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3202,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-06-24|2018-06-10,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.3.1,hourly,,,,1,26,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",tips-when-you-travel,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:55:23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3204,"Personal Legacy Considerations","Aging well includes having a firm grasp on <strong><em>life ever after</em></strong>. The void that loved ones feel upon the death of a parent or close relative represents the part of their life that is suddenly empty due to the loss. The emotional impact of a parent’s passing can be unpredictable, since the state of mind immediately following a sudden death can trigger feelings of regret or guilt over unresolved issues.

One way to help families cope with death is by preparing an <a href=""http://www.life-legacies.com/ethicalwills/"">ethical will</a>, which conveys your core values and is a loving gesture to help them through the bereavement period. Although an ethical will is not a legal document, you can use it to pass on life lessons, express gratitude, explain your reasoning for certain events in your life, and to leave personal messages for family members. An ethical will is also a good (and somewhat clever!) way to make amends with estranged family members by conveying or requesting forgiveness for lingering misunderstandings or petty disagreements. In doing so, you may forge a new legacy of peace for your descendants. It’s a little wimpy – but in essence long-standing family feuds can be settled from the grave, and in doing so - release loyal relatives from taking up a cause that may have lost importance within the family, or simply isn’t their battle to fight.

Another concept to consider is the benefit of sharing your personal legacy while you’re still alive. Imagine being able to witness the positive impact of passing on monetary and/or personal gifts to your loved ones. My parents were thoughtful enough to extend financial perks to both my brother and myself while still alive by paying off a mortgage and funding a year’s worth of private schooling for their grandkids. The conditions attached to the gifts were a tad obscure and crafty, including hosting a ""burn the mortgage"" party for the whole family and having the kids write them a thank you note in the language of their choice (I think it was Swahili or something similar). Nonetheless, it was a win-win. My folks were overjoyed to see us so excited – and naturally we were floored by their generosity!

Here’s another great idea that an acquaintance of mine recently shared. After her mom completed both a legal and living will down to the last detail, including the exact flowers she would prefer on her casket, she took an innovative approach for allocating personal items to her three daughters. Several years ago, she instructed each one to pre-select an item from all of her possessions on their birthdays, beginning with the oldest child. It has since become an annual tradition. She said it gives her mom peace and a sense of joy in knowing which daughters would have certain things. At first, her family thought it was a bit morbid to be mentally divvying up her personal items while she is still alive, but after a few years, it has evolved into a social celebration of birthdays and her mom’s legacy of life.

By sharing your personal legacy while still alive, inheritors are able to properly express gratitude and experience the positive effects of your generosity.

If you have several children, ask each of them which of your personal possessions they would like to inherit and do your best to make it so. Although it may seem like a difficult task, everyone will honor your wishes if they are clarified before your death. Some have reported experiencing a sense of comfort and closure in knowing where possessions will go after death and it minimizes hurt feelings among family survivors.

If your legacy includes significant assets, such as real estate and a stock portfolio, it’s important that you state your final wishes while of sound mind and body to avoid conflicts among inheritors after you are gone.

Memories forged throughout your lifetime may have keepsakes, photographs and mementos associated with them that you wish to share with specific people. The inheritance of a prized fishing reel, treasured orchard collection or vintage piano may inspire a specific grandchild, friend, niece or nephew that expressed interest in or helped encourage your dedication to the skill. Express appreciation by spreading a legacy of token gifts, collectables and photographs among those that may not be mentioned specifically in a formal will, such as 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> generation relatives and close friends. Acknowledge any <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/info_8700929_fictive-kinship.html"">fictive kinship</a> relationships you may have nurtured over the years by passing on mementos to those that have remained a constant part of your life.

If one family member stands out in your life or provided the majority of your caregiving throughout your past, express your appreciation with a personal keepsake or gift, such as a favorite piece of jewelry, and include a hand-written message of gratitude.

A <a href=""http://www.alllaw.com/articles/wills_and_trusts/article7.asp"">living will</a> is essential to clarify your specific desires regarding the final stages of aging, illness, dying and death. In doing so, you articulate your wishes regarding end-of-life care, including your preferences for resuscitation in the event of heart or lung stoppage. <a href=""http://www.dyingwithdignity.ca/"">Dying with dignity</a> includes clarification of <a href=""http://en.allexperts.com/q/Life-Support-Issues-2065/terminating-life-support-organ.htm"">life support, organ donation</a> and <a href=""http://elder-law.laws.com/advance-directives/do-not-resuscitate-orders"">Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)</a> requests. A living will and <a href=""http://elder-law.lawyers.com/health-care-power-of-attorney.html"">a medical power of attorney</a> requires that you appoint a trusted relative or friend to carry out your final wishes, and offers assurance of peaceful compliance by family members after your death.

As stated in my previously published book, ‘<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Caregivers-Survival-Handbook-Revised/dp/0399536426"">The Caregiver’s Survival <em>Guide,</em><em>’</em></a> it’s best to discuss end-of-life issues before the end is imminent and when you are healthy, of sound mind and independent. Life and death situations can occur unexpectedly, such as the onset of a terminal illness, and are not the ideal time to make rational decisions. Clarify you wishes through a living will and include a <a href=""http://www.legacyletter.org/"">legacy letter</a> to articulate your inner thoughts and pearls of wisdom for surviving loved-ones.

A legacy letter can be an addendum to your legal will to designate any philanthropic legacies you may wish to endow, including the reason for your generosity. For instance, you may choose to donate a cash amount to the local animal shelter and designate it to be applied exclusively toward adoption fees incurred by those over the age of 65 because you personally experienced the joys of owning a dog or cat during your golden years.

We’ve all seen movies depicting the formal reading of a relative’s last will and testament, which often includes a video recording of the deceased to express their last wishes. That’s actually a very good idea and gaining in popularity, thanks to the digital age. A video that is shared after your death is an effective way of stating your personal legacy preferences with clarity, sincerity and compassion. Remove all doubt regarding your decision to pass on a vintage automobile to your 16 year-old grandson by explaining your reasons for doing so. State conditions that are concise and reasonable, such as his successful high school graduation and acceptance into college, prior to granting his claim on the vehicle.",,"2020-02-17 19:59:06",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/personal-legacy-considerations/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/legacy.jpeg,legacy,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/legacy.jpeg,,Caregiving,,"alive|death|express|express gratitude|family|family members|final wishes|includes|legacy|legacy letter|life|living|passing|personal|personal legacy|sharing your personal|sharing your personal legacy|sound mind|state|wishes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3205,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-06-24|2018-06-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,74,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",personal-legacy-considerations,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 14:16:35",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3208,"Quick Tips on How To Heal","It is possible to halt or minimize the aging effects caused by years of poor diet choices. Consider the benefits of neutralizing potentially harmful toxins created by three common culprits in the American diet: red meat, dairy products and bad carbs. It's crucial to balance the acids in your body, since acidic wastes can accumulate and cause your organs to break down and malfunction. This can often be difficult, since the average western diet is acid-producing. An <a href=""http://www.doctoroz.com/slideshow/alkaline-food-plan?gallery=true"">alkaline-food-plan</a> balances the adverse effects of a traditional American diet that is rich in butter, animal proteins and wheat-based products. Alkaline food sources can also stave off diabetes and weight gain and improve digestion. Include alkaline foods in your diet like citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli, tropical fruits, like papaya and pineapples, avocados, wild-caught salmon, cinnamon and ground ginger.

Rethink your cooking oil to scale back bad fats. Gravitate toward recipes that adapt well to natural ingredients, such as substituting fruit juice for cooking oil in baking. There are over <a href=""http://wellnessmama.com/5734/101-uses-for-coconut-oil/"">101 uses for coconut oil</a>, which makes a good case for why the miracle oil should be in both your medicine cabinet and food pantry. Coconut oil comes from medium-chain triglycerides, which are quickly utilized by the body instead of stored as fat. The wonder oil aids in vitamin and mineral absorption. Make coconut oil a part of your regular diet to help raise good cholesterol, and balance out blood sugar. Besides dietary advantages, coconut oil is also a useful weapon to ward off inflammation, bacteria and viruses, and can be applied topically to discourage wrinkles, warts, moles, athlete’s foot, acne, dandruff and many other symptoms.

<a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Inflammation-and-Heart-Disease_UCM_432150_Article.jsp"">Inflammation</a> can be damaging to your heart, since it is how blood vessels cope with abnormal plaque levels that accumulate within a vessel. The plaque may eventually cause a rupture, and can trigger a blood clot formation. Turmeric, black pepper, garlic and olive oil are just a few of the anti-inflammatory ingredients that should be included in your diet to replace their unhealthy counterparts, such as corn and canola oils.

<a href=""http://www.naturalnews.com/042753_Epsom_salt_baths_remarkable_health_benefits_detoxificatin_technique.html"">Epsom salt</a> also minimizes inflammation and helps to detox the body with magnesium and sulfates. The use of regular Epsom salt baths has been shown to improve the symptoms of many health conditions including athlete's foot, gout, toenail fungus, sprains, bruises and muscle soreness. Regular Epsom salt baths help to ease inflammation of many chronic disease or chronic pain sufferers while improving mineral and sulfur content in the body. Add Epsom salt to your bath water twice a week and soak for ten minutes to help neutralize and detox the body by drawing out toxins through your pores. Finish with a clear-water rinse and a brisk scrub to fully remove dead skin deposits while feeling invigorated.

3231,"The Silent Generation Characteristics and Facts You Need To Know","The silent generation is most recognized for upholding their values; they exhibit a strong loyalty to their personal beliefs and possess a strong work ethic. Born between 1925 and 1945, seniors are often forgotten but owing to their significance and profound contributions, the silent generation is not so silent at all. We take a look at the silent generation characteristics and the facts that you need to know.
<h3>Who is the Silent Generation?</h3>
The average ages of the silent generation are 75 to 80 years. Many may argue the older generation is set in their ways, but there is much to learn from this generation, who were raised in an era free from technology and absent of the many privileges millennial enjoy today.

Ravaged by a time global-scale war and economic turmoil, the silent generation shows greater appreciation for family, the smaller things in life and gratitude.

Referred to as the silent generation, the population that existed during this period was considered to be oppressed, owing to the constraints and fears of the war. Silent generation facts point to significant hardships owing to Communism, the Great Depression and a lack of social pleasures as we know it. This period included great unemployment, and the resulting difficulties from an inability to put food on the table to keeping a roof over their head. It was marked aa a group of struggling seniors. They are distinguished by a connection to a group identity rather than an individual one.

&nbsp;
<h3>Silent Generation Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The most significant silent generation facts include families being raised in a time of economic uncertainty and a lack of modern luxuries. Owing to financial restrictions and ongoing difficulties, the expenditure of this population is rather obscured.</li>
 	<li>The silent generation is characterized by a strong work ethic. They struggled in ravaged financial markets, and therefore had to develop an inner drive to work hard and get to where they wanted to be in a short period.</li>
 	<li>Silent generation characteristics include discipline, upholding of values, gratitude and an appreciation for the ""simplicities"" in life.</li>
 	<li>This senior population is best characterized by a strong sense of determination and willpower. Many had to seek employment and pursue difficult ventures to experience economic relief and freedoms.</li>
 	<li>Their belief is in the policies created for social reform and the ability to overcome the limitations of the Great Depression.</li>
 	<li>Silent generation facts have shown that individuals of this time were either part of or born during World War II.</li>
 	<li>Many from this group focus on salvaging valuables and finances. The silent generation steers away from wastage and places significant value on economic resources.</li>
 	<li>The generation of this time, did not work to create attention or make a noise in protests, but rather focused on working silently to achieve their goals and sustain living conditions.</li>
 	<li>Commonly referred to as traditionalists, these individuals marked by the silent generation remain well respected. Their sense of endearment, struggle, and efforts to avoid waste are significantly different from the obtrusive and luxury expenditure of modern generations.</li>

3235,"Baby Boomers Lifestyle Trends to Follow in 2018","When men and women belonging to the baby boomer generation were questioned on their average life expectancy, the answers were quite surprising. Most individuals expected to reach their late sixties to mid seventies, but the reality of senior life expectancy is that more people are reaching their 80s and 90s and still living independently! The greater longevity in mature adults has also had an impact on business. Products, services and brand creation are geared towards lifestyle enhancements, support efforts, and ways of addressing the various stages in the lives of the silent generation. We look at the latest baby boomers lifestyle trends for 2018.

Companies are taking advantage of the opportunity to advertise through email subscriptions, newsletters, social media and online strategy to reach the baby boomer market.

Emphasis is on lifestyle factors creating relaxation, security and pleasurable activities.
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
The average age of the baby boomer is 75 years. Statistics have shown a rise in the number of persons living beyond 80 and having to manage ongoing frailty or chronic conditions.

Men and women of the silent generation are more likely to invest in medical devices, gadgets and resources that address their clinical needs.

With more people having to manage health conditions individually or that of a spouse, there is greater interest in supportive solutions to improve everyday living. From surgery to medical alert devices offering 24 hour online assistance, businesses are focusing on wellness solutions.

3378,"Fitness Over Fifty","I’ve always advocated regular exercise and a variety of activities to maximize the mind and body’s natural ability to sustain long life while helping you look your best. It takes dedication and resourcefulness to sustain a lifetime of fitness and vitality. With the right attitude, regular exercise can become the means to a happy ending. Although you may think it’s a stretch to associate daily fitness with happiness, there is a detectable level of instant gratification that comes with exercise. After about 20 minutes of walking, running or exercising, our bodies release endorphins to the brain as a response to physical discomfort and extra activity, and can produce a sense of euphoria – often called a <em>runner’s high</em>. And let’s not underestimate the perks of looking and feeling better – that’s worth a few extra points on the happiness meter. Within this chapter, learn the facts regarding fitness and longevity, including some exciting updates in state-of-the-art technology and DNA research that can level the playing field.

It doesn’t matter what age or level of fitness you’re at right now, there is simply no good reason to avoid exercise. Even swinging your arms while marching in place for 3 to 5 minutes several times a day can get the blood pumping and keep your system from becoming sedentary. It’s always best to push your limits gradually with mini goals, such as increasing the number of repetitions or walking an extra quarter mile when you reach your good heart-rate zone – which is discussed in this chapter.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ng3O6TQv8g8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Keep it interesting by changing up the routine often, but make sure you get some form of exercise every week and strive for a blended mix of high and low-impact moves in order to effectively increase your heart rate throughout the entire workout. If you have fallen off the exercise bandwagon, re-approach the workout as a novice to discover and reset your correct pace, since it has probably changed.

<a href=""http://www.eldergym.com/exercises-for-the-elderly.html"">Regular exercise</a> should begin with a ten minute warm-up and end with a ten minute cool down and include pulse and heart-rate monitoring before, during and after any workout. Prior to starting, consult your doctor to advise that you are going to begin exercising or increasing your activity level. This is especially true if you are currently on blood pressure or cardiac medication or have any of the following symptoms:
<ul>
 	<li>A heart condition or other chronic condition, such as diabetes</li>
 	<li>Chronic joint or back pain or discomfort of any kind</li>
 	<li>Pain in the chest, neck and left arm region</li>
 	<li>Shortness of breath before, during or after workouts</li>
 	<li>Unexplained dizziness</li>
</ul>
When deciding on an exercise program, make sure it’s one that pushes you at the correct aerobic pace, with varying levels of cardio movements, resistance and repetitions, and enough diversity to keep you motivated. Background music can enhance your sense of rhythm through synchronized movements and routines, such as <a href=""http://video.about.com/exercise/Beginner-Zumba-Steps.htm"">Zumba</a>, which spices up your moves with a salsa twist. Try to enjoy yourself instead of stereotyping your workout as a punishment you must pay because of something you plan to do or have already done – like eating a rich dessert. Your workout pace has as much, if not more, to do with your fitness level than your physical age. We all know people well into their 50’s and 60’s that keep up with their much-younger relatives and friends. Sad to say, the opposite isn’t always true since the age of technology has created new generations of couch potatoes that think a rousing video game is a good workout after a full day behind a school or office desk.

It’s important to always stay fit, but exercise <em>does</em> take on a slightly-different meaning as you age. Even if you are gearing up for a spot in the annual <a href=""http://seniorgames.org/"">Senior Olympics</a>, use caution to avoid falling or over-exerting your muscles, since broken bones and pulled muscles take longer to heal as we continue to age. It can actually take several months to a year to recover from a broken hip and the surgery it requires. And if a proper physical therapy regimen isn’t followed, the resulting tendonitis can be extremely painful and limit mobility, thus increasing the chances of another fall. If high-impact exercise is no longer on the radar, it becomes more about maintaining good blood flow, joint health and physical and mental stamina.

If you are over the age of 60 or new to the fitness scene, you may want to join an exercise regime that speaks to the needs of seniors and newbies. The <a href=""http://www.meltmethod.com/about"">MeltMethod</a>, is a ten minute routine which focuses on reducing inflammation through a transformative program that “brings your body back to a more ideal state through body awareness,” and thereby reduces chronic aches and pains. Another is the <a href=""http://t-tapp.com/"">T-Tapp</a> method, which offers several levels of workouts, including a senior fit program created to focus on areas that are critical as we age – maximizing muscle activation, circulation and lymphatic health with an exercise regime that incorporates mindful movements with leverage isometrics – all designed to improve strength, flexibility and heart health, as well as increase energy and decrease inflammation.

It’s been determined that regular exercise is credited with slowing Alzheimer’s progression – and sometimes it is more effective than certain medications prescribed for that purpose. According to an article in <a href=""http://www.stopagingnow.com/articles/29656/The-Secret-to-Preventing-Most-Age-Related-Diseases"">Stop Aging Now</a>, “The latest statistics reveal that one in three people will die with some form of Alzheimer’s disease or some other form of dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease recently escalated to become the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S.” With an alarming rate of diagnosis that tallies one new case of Alzheimer’s every 76 seconds, it becomes more critical to do whatever is necessary to stave off the disease - and right now, regular physical activity and exercise is leading the way. Recent findings reveal that exercise promotes a significant increase in the intensity of brain activity in eleven brain regions, which included the same areas of the brain that lead to a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.",,"2020-10-27 13:33:10",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/fitness-over-fifty/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Vivacious-at-50-pic1.jpg,Vivacious-at-50-pic1,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Vivacious-at-50-pic1.jpg,,Longevity,,"activity|age|alzheimer's|alzheimer's disease|blood|brain|disease|exercise|exercise regime|extra|fitness|form|increase|increasing|level|physical|regular exercise|right|right now|workout",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3379,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,517,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",fitness-over-fifty,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:51:59",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3382,"Reinventing Yourself","There has never been a better time to relax, let your hair down, and enjoy life. Sometimes, in order to <em>fully</em> embrace life, you have to re-think your priorities and re-invent yourself. In the process, you may decide to relinquish control of a stressful chore that you constantly avoid or often wait until the last possible moment to tackle.

Letting go of situations that create stress may also be your ticket to better health. In doing so, you are able to clear the way for more enjoyable endeavors. For example, if filing your income taxes every year makes your skin crawl, enlist the help of a qualified person that you trust, or hire an accountant to assume the responsibility. By delegating the task, you are able to finally put an end to a long-standing pet peeve, and fill the gap with something fun!

Aging gracefully means accepting the incremental changes happening to you while retaining control of the total package. Your personal appearance should be a reflection of your lifestyle. For instance, opt for a low-maintenance hairstyle that extends the time between salon visits and keeps your schedule open for more exciting things. Flaunt your fun side with upbeat, colorful accessories that you’ve probably already got lurking in the back of your closet, such as scarves and hats to perk up your mood and appearance—plus the extra UV ray protection is a smart idea. Keep up-to-date with age-appropriate fashion trends that complement your relaxed attitude.

Extend your new attitude to include your home, especially if it’s overdue for a makeover. Size up your living space and consider a cosmetic facelift for the rooms you spend the most time in, with updates like a cozy chair, a new rug and a fresh coat of paint, all put together in your favorite colors to enhance your comfort and relaxation. While you’re still in re-decorating mode, pack away the obvious dust collectors in boxes, and decide which ones to slowly transition back into the space by determining if they add to the chaos or contribute to your overall enjoyment. Eliminate clutter and downsize from an overflow of objects within your immediate environment with the goal focused on re-inventing yourself. Remember: <em>In order to paint the next picture, there has to be enough room left on your canvas.</em>

Unless there’s an emotional attachment, consider repurposing less-meaningful items in other areas of your home, passing them onto relatives or friends, or donating them to a local charitable organization for resale. Use the extra space to add some fresh plants and greenery for a renewed sense of vitality throughout your home. Find a pleasing location to accommodate a desk for your personal computing sessions, the <em>most accessible doorway to re-invention</em>.

Express your creativity by enrolling in an art course or pottery class to add personally-crafted updates to your home. Visit a new place of worship or renew ties with your existing one to experience a sense of fellowship and join the choir to explore your musical side. Add a gaming console to your home entertainment center and get interactive while getting fit. Systems like Xbox, PlayStation and Wii all offer exciting inter-active gaming options perfect for the living-room, including bowling, dancing, exercising and more.

An online article entitled, “Seven Surprising Things That Will Make You Healthier,” by <a href=""http://theweek.com/article/index/254525/7-surprising-things-that-will-make-you-healthier"">The Week</a>, equates certain activities, such as video gaming and group singing to the holy grail of mental longevity. The article quotes from findings of a recent study in which researchers asked volunteers between the ages of 60 and 85 to play a fast-paced video game that involved driving while identifying signs. Participants' skills were monitored at the onset and after a month of playing three times a week. Not only did their performance improve dramatically, but they also scored higher afterward on tests of short-term memory and long-term focus. The study ""shows you can take older people who aren't functioning well and make them cognitively younger through this training,"" says MIT neuroscientist Earl Miller. ""It's a very big deal."" What great way to have fun while improving your mental stamina!

With extra time on your hands, you are able to pursue interests that spark your creativity. A <a href=""http://www.retireamericanstyle.com/retirement-hobbies.html"">retirement hobby</a> may inspire dedication and passion in later years, as time allows you to complete projects with greater success and less distractions. Consider activities that you may have previously overlooked, such as acquiring collectables, creative arts-and-crafts projects, music and sporting pursuits, or perhaps a particular outdoor hobby you’ve always been interested in, like bee-keeping or growing prize-wining roses.

Why not round up some of your friends and designate a specific day or evening for group activities, such as chess tournaments or a friendly game of poker. A physically interactive game or activity, such as charades or karaoke, will keep you on your feet while having fun. If the weather is nice, take it outside for some friendly competition with activities, such as horseshoes or remote-controlled car races. Cycling with friends is also a great sport that engages both physical and social skills and is easier on the joints than jogging. Join an existing <a href=""http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art64215.asp"">cycling club</a> or recruit other cyclists to plan biking trips for designated bike paths and parkways within your community.

Keep moving to discover the joy in easily-accessible pursuits that broaden your outlook. Local museums, galleries and art shows can expand your passion for art in a wide range of creative media. If you’ve always been curious about the entertainment arts, volunteer as a stage hand for a local play or musical production to experience the excitement of being backstage on opening night. Or audition for a stage part, if that suits your fancy.

Personality traits can influence successful longevity and may require deliberate focus to affect real change. If you’ve always been shy in social settings, strive to break out of your comfort zone by setting mini goals for yourself at your next social event, such as striking up causal dialog with at least three or more new people. Reaching out to others can be empowering since many people are approachable and often eager to engage in stimulating conversation, especially in a social setting.

Explore what makes you tick, your general feeling, attitude and overall personality traits to unlock some basic truths about yourself. A truthful assessment can reveal combinations that lead to poor choices, keeping you in better control. Indeed, trait changes may occur slowly and for many people may not occur at all. Yet for others, change becomes a pivotal point for influencing longevity outcomes.

Change and diversity is an important part of the human psyche, as each of us searches to find our uniqueness in a sea of conformity. Retirement is an excuse to break the mold which defined you for most of your life. The element of surprise keeps the blood flow pumping with adrenaline bursts to fuel our adventurous nature. Break out of your comfort zone once in a while to see what’s new and exciting beyond your front door.

3386,"Sound Sleep at Any Age","A good night’s sleep is one of the most effective tools known to enhance mental and physical stamina. The lack of sleep can be linked to certain symptoms, including poor concentration, dizziness, headaches, weight gain, depression and general fatigue throughout the day.

With maturity comes change, including the amount of time we devote to regular sleep cycles. Sleep deprivation may seem like a minor inconvenience, but as we age, there is a higher risk, since <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270120.php"">insomnia is linked to chronic illnesses</a>, such as Diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, according to Medical News Today. There are several steps you can take to cure a consistent or chronic <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2010/09/02/lack-of-sleep-can-cause-depression-weight-gain-and-even-death/"">lack of sleep</a>, including shutting down your internet connection at least an hour before bedtime.

According to <a href=""http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/let-sleep-work-you"">the National Sleep Foundation</a>, mature adults require between 7 to 9 hours of restful sleep each night to maintain good health and mental focus. The foundation points to specifics that can enhance the sleep mood. To begin with, avoid alcohol, cigarettes and tobacco products since they are sleep disrupters, as is chocolate. Of course, it’s important to eliminate caffeine prior to bedtime and in the late afternoon. Instead, reach for a healthy snack of yogurt or nuts to boost afternoon slumps. Caffeine-free coffee and tea can be substituted in moderation to minimize the jitters, or you may want to enjoy the benefits of drinking an herbal tea, such as chamomile, before bedtime to relieve stress and relax your muscles.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/bMFcg5tf8qY?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Turn your bedroom into a comfort zone that is conducive to restful sleep. Layer windows with functioning treatments, such as traversing draperies and operable blinds that can block out light when a daytime sleep-in is called for, and provide extra insulation during weather extremes. Place reading materials nearby with adequate lighting and comfortable back support to enhance restful sleep. Resist the urge to leave your cell phone bedside, unless it is part of your security plan, and consider muting the ringer to avoid unwanted wake-up calls. If your bedroom includes a sitting area, you probably also have a TV. While enjoying the entertainment value it offers in the privacy of your bedroom is appealing, try to avoid depending on the TV as a crutch to help you fall asleep. Instead, opt for listening to soft, instrumental music to relax your mind at bedtime.

Although regular exercise is important, complete vigorous workouts at least 3 hours before hitting the sack. A warm bath and a glass of milk may sound a bit old fashioned, but the combination before bed encourages slumber. Even an occasional beer before bedtime may help, since the <a href=""http://www.cantsleep.org/aids/hops.html"">hops</a> in most brews can ease digestion and sooth stomach spasms, while promoting sleep. Avoid turning up the thermostat at bedtime, as resting body temperatures require less heat and will relax better in a room that is dark, cool and comfortable.

The foundation shares interesting insights about our brains and why it’s important to sleep at night.

“<em>Sleep is regulated by two brain processes. One is the restorative process when sleep occurs naturally in response to how long we are awake; the longer we are awake, the stronger is the drive to sleep. The second process controls the timing of sleep and wakefulness during the day-night cycle…... This part of the brain is influenced by light so that we naturally tend to get sleepy at night when it is dark and are active during the day when it is light.”</em>

Our body functions are regulated to remain in sync with our nocturnal sleep cycles to ensure kidney functions and blood pressure coincide with the resting body. Light influences the biological clock to ensure important hormones are secreted at the correct levels during the sleep cycle. Simultaneously, blood pressure is lowered and kidney functions change. The Sleep Foundation suggests you <a href=""http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/let-sleep-work-you"">let sleep work for you</a> rather than fighting against the perpetual time clock we are all born with. Turn to the restorative power of sleep when you experience fatigue and no other option makes as much sense. Don’t explain yourself to others if a power nap is on the horizon or becomes part of your regular routine- just do it!

However, ensure that it really is just a power nap. Afternoon naps that consistently exceed much beyond an hour may indicate the lack of proper rest at night, or perhaps chronic sleep apnea. Check with your physician if long naps become a main component in your regular sleep cycle.

Avoid the regular use of prescription or over-the-counter sleep aids to prevent dependency issues that can lead to depression. Melatonin and certain non-caffeine herbal teas, such as Chamomile, may enhance sleep-inducing moods to aid the sleep cycle with a natural approach.

Sweet dreams should be a regular part of your sleep cycle. Practice silent meditation prior to shutting down your mind for the night and focus on something pleasant instead of counting sheep and your dreams just might come true!",,"2020-08-17 13:46:55",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/sound-sleep-at-any-age/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/elderly-woman-sleeping.jpg,elderly-woman-sleeping,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/elderly-woman-sleeping.jpg,,Longevity,,"avoid|bedtime|blood pressure|chronic|cycle|enhance|foundation|kidney functions|lack|lack of sleep|light|night|power nap|regular sleep|restful|restful sleep|resting body|sleep cycle|sleep cycles|sleep foundation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3387,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,517,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",sound-sleep-at-any-age,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:51:14",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3390,"Intergenerational Activities","Blended families extend in all directions, with branches that often include several step-children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, nieces and nephews – all perfect sidekicks for the centenarian. Nurturing families are one of the keys to successful longevity and often the result of instilled traditions and cultural influences passed down through generations.

We can all be inspired by multi-generational cultures that abound in distant locations, such as Vilcabamba, a small, isolated town located at an altitude of approximately 4,500 feet in Ecuador’s Andes mountain region, where a nurturing attitude is embraced by all ages. Translated, Vilcabamba means “<em>Sacred Valley</em>,” and for good reason. The valley sustains a year-round temperate climate of 68 degrees that supports a robust variety of vegetables, fruit and grains which helps the villagers flourish within their pristine environment that is void of most modern conveniences. Although residents of the humble village lack the basics, such as inside plumbing, they have access to pure mineral drinking water, which is a priceless commodity by any standard. The lack of material abundance, as gauged by Western standards, is seldom eulogized or lamented among villagers. Instead, they embrace a genuine sense of love, joy and unselfishness that sustains all ages through life’s transitions.

Notable scientists, physicians and respected journalists, including Grace Halsell and Dr. Alexander Leaf, stayed in the region for an extended time to live among the locals and observe the village customs and culture. Besides Halsell and Leaf, many others have taken note of the general attitude in Vilcabama’s residents, as a sense of communal harmony is interwoven through every age group and every level of their lives. The oldest villagers are regarding as the most respected generation, worthy of perpetual admiration and praise, and are often referred to as, “<em>The Ancient Ones</em>.” The small community celebrates and embraces their aging citizens, rather than putting them out to pasture. The youngsters are eager to enjoy the company of their elders, knowing there is wisdom to be gained from each encounter.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wCeOETYaQvY?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The longevity guide entitled, “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345490118?tag=wwwhealthyat1-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0345490118&amp;adid=1R3EH1ZKK9YY2ZPSJKQP&amp;"">Healthy at 100</a>,” shares the insights of Halsell and Leaf regarding the amazing cross-generational connections and overall sense of vitality that exists among the locals. The guide suggests Western families emulate the successful traits of these cultures in order to open our hearts and minds to the aging population and discard the notion that getting older is a death sentence that leads to isolation and eventually, the dreaded nursing home, or even worse - a lonely death. Tim Robbins, a best-selling author on the subject, shares this insights:

<em>“If we want to create a healthy relationship to aging, then cultures like Abkhasia and Vilcabamba have much to offer us in how we understand our place in the life cycle. In these cultures, elders are looked up to and appreciated for their wisdom. They feel socially useful and needed.</em>”

Although it requires a village to successfully adapt this kind of attitude toward the elderly, positive attitudes can be instilled and passed through all generations to ensure that respect begins in the home. Emulate the endearing Vilcabamban attitude toward aging and celebrate the accomplishments of older loved ones with symbols of honor and appreciation instead of succumbing to morbid clichés, like ‘<em>over the hill’</em> and ‘<em>old fart’</em> that imply the end of a person’s useful life.

Americans, in general, have embraced mobility to keep pace with a society that requires regular travel between time zones, and sometimes even permanent re-location from original family roots. Re-establish broken connections with endearing family members whom have moved away with a Vilcabamban approach that maintains strong family ties through both good and bad times. Keep a record of birthdays, graduations and other important dates in the lives of loved ones to acknowledge their milestones and encourage them to celebrate.

A mutual hobby, game, sport, television show or activity can be the common link to share personal interests with other family members of various ages. Parents with demanding careers and day schedules appreciate older relatives that offer to fill the gaps by providing mentoring time with their kids. After-school activities are the ideal environment to fill in for grateful working parents. Demonstrate an interest in children’s sporting activities, science project or scouting field trips, and offer to tag along or chaperone at the next organized event.

Pitch in with details at family meals and gatherings. Help with meal preparations, or learn a video game to interact with the kids while reaffirming your vitality. Be open to learning about the fantasy world of children’s characters if your grandson expresses his enthusiasm for Buzz Lightyear, and consider dressing in costume with the kids for Halloween activities or special events. Family vacations increase the benefits of spending leisure time with the entire family in a relaxed setting, such as a cruise or seaside cottage rental, while providing ample postcard moments that everyone can look back on and appreciate.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEoDFEBwCq0?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

With age comes respect, and perhaps a few other benefits. Pull the age card when all else fails to enjoy the perks of seniority and to receive special favors from younger relatives that you miss seeing on a regular basis. For example, if you would like your grandson to pay you a visit and hopefully, help bathe your dog, don’t be afraid to ask. Extend the courtesy by letting him know how much you enjoy seeing him and invite him to have lunch with you. In return, you’ll probably receive his appreciation, and a bath for Waldo.",,"2020-05-17 13:52:14",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/intergenerational-activities/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Intergenerational-Activities-for-the-Elderly-Learning.jpg,Intergenerational-Activities-for-the-Elderly-Learning,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Intergenerational-Activities-for-the-Elderly-Learning.jpg,,Longevity,,"activities|age|ages|aging|attitude|cultures|enjoy|families|family|family members|halsell|halsell and leaf|kids|leaf|offer|sense|time|vilcabamba|village|villagers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3391,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,15,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",intergenerational-activities,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 14:16:00",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3394,"Stretch for Success","Have you ever noticed how often dogs and cats stretch over the course of a day - especially after sleeping? We can all take a lesson from our four-footed friends, since regular stretching is as common as breathing is for them. It sends signals to the brain and body to get the blood flowing. If you’ve ever encountered a person who was so stiff they could barely walk, there’s a good chance they don’t stretch. Sometimes, it’s the simplest things that can make the biggest difference in your comfort level.

In the morning, it can ease muscle stiffness by waking up your body with a series of simple arm, shoulder and chest extensions before starting your day. Stretching increases the range of motion in your joints as well as blood flow to muscle areas.

Some of the <a href=""http://www.nextavenue.org/article/2012-10/fiftysomething-workout-your-5-biggest-mistakes"">biggest workout mistakes</a> include forgetting to stretch and warm up prior to and after exercising. The practice actually lengthens muscles to increase muscle flexibility and is a must during physical therapy and rehabilitation. It protects the joints by warming the body up and decreasing the risk of exercise-related injury.

It’s just as important to stretch your muscles back to their resting length after each workout. Exercising your muscles with resistance results in stronger - and temporarily shorter muscles. Shortened muscle fibers are more easily injured, so make sure to stretch properly <em>after</em> exercising when your muscles are still warm to minimize the soreness of post-workout muscles caused by microscopic muscle tears. A warm bath or shower will also suffice to warm you up, if you prefer.

Stretching should never cause pain. Discover the pain threshold and kick it down a few notches before holding the stretch. Adjust your breathing rhythms to sync up with each movement to maximize their benefits, and never hold your breath when stretching. Check your range of motion on both sides of your body to ensure they are equal. Proper hydration will maximize the benefits of stretching.

By the way, do you know how much water should you drink? Experts suggest at least eight- 8 ounce servings of water every day, or about .236 milliliters. That estimate is based on an average weight of 150 pounds and average body temperatures within your environment. Others suggest that there is no set requirement of water per day. You should always reach for water first when you are thirsty, as any added ingredients will dilute the hydration benefits of pure H2O. Verify that your urine is either white or slightly yellow as an indication that you are properly hydrated. Extremely dark urine can indicate dehydration or other possible health issues. Every individual has different water consumption requirements and it is difficult to apply a general rule. To stay hydrated, include at least 8 ounces of water with your stretching routine, and make sure you get your daily quota.

There are certain conditions which are not conducive to stretching, including fractured bones and muscle and joint strains, as extending weakened muscles can result in further injury or impair the healing process. Check with your doctor first if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.

If the back of your shoulder is tight, you may be prone to rotator cuff problems, common with golf, tennis and racquetball. Elongating the muscles in your upper back can promote good posture and ease problems associated with these types of activities.

The Mayo Clinic offers an easy-to-follow <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/stretching/SLS-20076840?s=3"">stretching exercise slide show</a> to guide you through the ten basic stretches that should be a regular part of your exercise routine.

Try doing <a href=""http://physicaltherapy.about.com/od/flexibilityexercises/tp/Towel-stretches.htm"">towel stretches</a> or using a belt to isolate stretching exercises for your hamstrings, back muscles, shoulders and your quadriceps muscle groups. Quadriceps maintain alignment of the kneecap and the front of your shin. Regular stretching of this muscle group will relieve tightness and help avoid kneecap dislocations.

<a href=""http://seniorliving.about.com/od/exercisefitnes1/a/stretching.htm"">The benefits of stretching</a> are even greater for seniors, since it can actually reduce the wear-and-tear on aging and settling joints that experience friction. It also activates fluids in your joints, lengthens the individual muscle fibers, helps to remove waste products, and reduces muscle soreness. Flexibility is essential to maintain good health; without flexibility, a cycle of pain, stiffness and muscle loss will remain and invite unwanted toxins to settle into inactive joints and muscles. The simple habit of regular stretching will maintain the flexibility your body needs to ensure good overall health and increase longevity, and it’s something you can begin to do immediatel

3398,"How's Your quality of life","No one envisions their final days confined to a wheelchair while eating applesauce and oatmeal for dinner. We all hope to achieve a good quality of life to sustain us until our last breath, but must also accept that certain factors are out of our control. Your lifelong habits contribute greatly to your overall well-being throughout the aging process. And it’s never too late to change bad habits that affect the quality of your life, such as over-eating or smoking. Evaluate problem areas to help unlock the why and how you react predictably to certain factors in life and to provide answers that can initiate change.

Since 1937, a <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/06.07/01-happywell.html"">study</a> has tracked 237 students at Harvard University and 332 socially disadvantaged youths from inner-city Boston through health, disease, and death in the quest to discover what keeps us happy and well.

""The study shows that successful aging is not an oxymoron,"" says George Vaillant, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the study for the past 35 years. ""You can add life to your years instead of just years to your life.”

Throughout the long-term study, Vaillant and his colleagues at Harvard University Health Services focused on seven predictors which are under our personal control, and if managed properly by the age 50, can lead to good physical and mental health through our 80’s and beyond. Obvious determining factors require us to quit smoking, exercise regularly, and not abuse alcohol. Some not-so-obvious indicators linked secondary education to overall good health and happiness, with money and social prestige trailing behind.

""Despite great differences in parental social class, college-tested intelligence, current income and job status, the health decline of college-educated, inner-city men was no more rapid than that of Harvard College graduates,"" Vaillant points out.

Other predicators in the study included marriage stability, exercise, weight management, and coping mechanisms. According to the study, uncontrollable factors that affect aging include family cohesion, genetic traits, and childhood temperament.

What I find interesting about this long-term study is two of the factors that were classified as uncontrollable. The first is ‘<em>family cohesion</em>’. What if you <em>could</em> affect a positive change toward your own family’s ability and willingness to communicate more often, which also includes their emotional, and other types of support? Consider the variables that have affected your family’s cohesion, such as the relocation of close relatives to another city or state, and make it your mission to re-establish open lines of communication. It may require organizing a long-overdue family reunion or establishing and promoting a family-centered social media site with a format to encourage instant chats, photos sharing and plans for future family gatherings. The point is - you <em>can</em> make a positive difference in your family’s cohesion, and in the process, improve the quality of life for yourself and other family members.

The second <em>uncontrollable</em> factor that is mentioned is<em> ‘genetic traits’. </em> Of course, your DNA is your genetic roadmap that is already set in motion from the moment of birth. What if you could learn enough through the study of your own DNA to increase your life by identifying a hereditary marker for certain diseases, such as hypertension or heart disease? At the time the Harvard study began in 1937, discussions about DNA and genetics were not on the table. But times have changed and on-going research findings from <a href=""http://www.genome.gov/10001772"">The Human Genome Project</a> have been ground-breaking in proving mankind now has the ability to identify genetic markers and in doing so may be able to keep you from falling into previously hidden pitfalls that are a part of your genetic path. Scientists are perfecting the science of <a href=""http://threedozeneggsandakettlebell.com/wp/?p=1412"">epigenetics</a>, which is proving that each gene has a layer that functions like ‘on’ and ‘off’ switches and we now know it is possible to change the expression of our genes – and particularly those that are indicators of diseases and malfunctions in our bodies. Although these types of tests haven’t become mainstream yet, you should expect to see more of this research affecting the quality of your preventative healthcare in the not-to-distant future to improve your genetic disposition toward a specific disease before it becomes a factor in your health, setting you on a preventative maintenance course that adds years to your time clock.

To make sure quality goes hand-in-hand with the quantity of your golden years, keep things interesting by changing up your routine from time to time. If you find your weeks running together like an automatic <em>wash, rinse and repeat</em> cycle, it’s time to switch to the manual cycle and change the itinerary. A chronically sedentary life symbolizes resting on your laurels, and can be the fast track to early death. Include physical activity in your daily life to enhance blood flow to the brain and crank up your fun factor.

Even if you are restricted by limited mobility, there are some activities and destinations that are well-equipped to handle accessibility issues, so you can still enjoy a quality life. Don’t allow immobility or other physical restrictions to become a crutch that hinders your options for enjoyment. Gravitate toward places that accept and solve these challenges to help overcome the stigma of physical limitations. Family-oriented venues, such as <a href=""https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/guests-with-disabilities/"">Disney theme parks</a> offer services for patrons with disabilities that can range from blindness, hearing, cognitive and mobility impairment. As mainstream America recognizes the value of welcoming the mass numbers of our aging population along with their families into the recreational mix, theme parks and family-oriented destinations cater to mobility-challenged patrons by providing streamlined access to attractions and rides, which also extends the perk of shorter waiting lines to accompanying family members. Share your family’s enthusiasm for excitement by joining in the adventure. It doesn’t matter if the family vacation is a Caribbean cruise or a trip to the <a href=""http://www.si.edu/Visit/VisitorsWithDisabilities"">Smithsonian Museum</a>, there’s really no reason not to participate.

In the big picture, it’s the quality of our days that defines our life. Resignation has no place in a happy heart. Instead, adopt a can-do attitude as you complete everyday tasks. Reach for the next milestone to keep clear sight of a high-quality life with long-term goals.

3402,"Genetics and you","Genetics leave a breadcrumb trail for your descendants to follow. Your achievements are not only a reflection of your life, but incentive for others to duplicate the pattern, particularly when it comes to achieving a high-quality long life.

Genetics is a factor when it comes to understanding our physical and biological strengths and weaknesses. Certain diseases are inherited, such as heart disease, but the shift toward healthy diets and exercise creates a new playing field that is coached by medical breakthroughs and surgical procedures to combat pre-existing and genetically inherited diseases, giving us all reason to hope for centenarian status. While <a href=""http://www.wordiq.com/definition/DNA"">understanding DNA</a> is not at the top of everyone’s list, it’s helpful to know it is often referred to as the ‘<em>molecule of heredity</em>.’

<a href=""http://www.genome.gov/12011238"">The Human Genome Project</a> was organized in the late 1980s and is a vast undertaking created solely for the purpose of exploring the genetic roadmap of human DNA. A book entitled, “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Map-Life-Project-Lawrence/dp/046504333X"">Drawing the Map of Life: Inside the Human Genome Project</a>,” explains that during the race to pin down the human sequence, the focus has shifted from discovering how alike we are to how different we are from each other. The ability to find disease markers in human DNA is creating a major shift toward preventive medicine, with the ability to increase the quality of life across the board. Efforts to expand this knowledge base have resulted in the recent and ongoing harvest and testing of tens of thousands of human DNA samples. By prioritizing, scientists can now begin to identify the DNA markers that make certain individuals more prone to certain diseases in a quest to discover which drugs benefit particular patients. The project has been active since the Clinton administration, and continues to make strides in understanding DNA, the building blocks of life.

“But while genes are certainly an important component of aging, they may not be the most relevant factor,” writes Alice Park in a cover story for Time Magazine, entitled <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1963392_1963365_1963378-2,00.html"">“How to Live 100 Years</a>.”

<em>“The good news is that according to animal studies, only about 30% of aging is genetically based, which means that the majority of other variables are in our hands. Not only can getting such factors under control help slow the aging process before it starts, it can also help those who are already in their golden years improve their fitness and strength.”</em>

The article also shares findings of recent studies showing that when seniors from ages 65 to 75 exercise with resistance weights, they can improve their scores on cognitive tests of memory and decision-making. Research proves that when people over 65 participate in regular physical activity, they lower the chance of developing cognitive impairment.

<a href=""http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/fac/yankner.php"">Dr. Bruce Yankner</a>, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, is studying what distinguishes brains that make it to 100 years with limited cognitive decline from those that succumb to the ravages of <a href=""http://www.alzfdn.org/AboutAlzheimers/diagnosis.html"">Alzheimer's disease</a> or other forms of dementia before age 85. This is a huge area of concern, since upward of 16 million people will develop Alzheimer’s disease by the year 2020, if a cure isn’t found. Yankner zeroed in on genes in the frontal cortex - which are involved in higher learning, planning and goal setting - of people ages 24 to 106. That's a big chronological span, and it netted a big genetic haul: the research confirmed our genes start to slow down after age 40. Using that information as a starting point, Yankner's group is trying to determine just what those genes do to affect individual aging processes. Now more than ever, the medical community is focused on pinpointing links and cures to the genetic disposition of Alzheimer’s disease, since it is on the horizon for over 16 million people at the rate of one new diagnoses every 76 seconds.

Yankner points to extenuating circumstances that are also a player in the picture. He states, “DNA is not destiny. Just as you can keep your body fit with good lifestyle habits and by avoiding pollutants, toxins and carcinogens, you may be able to keep your genes healthier. Environmentally triggered alterations in genes - known as <a href=""http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/inheritance/"">epigenetic changes</a> - can affect when a gene is activated, how robustly it is turned on and how it interacts with neighboring genes. Free radicals provide a very good case study of how epigenetic processes play out.”

Epigenetic inheritance may not be as easy to detect as DNA traits are, and it can manifest more quickly in response to signals from the environment and direct experiences of parents, which adds another dimension to the modern picture of evolution.",,"2018-07-17 14:05:41",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/genetics-and-you/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Genetics-1280x640.jpg,Genetics-1280x640,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Genetics-1280x640.jpg,,Health|Lifestyle|Longevity,,"aging|alzheimer's disease|certain diseases|cognitive|disease|diseases|dna|genes|genetic|genome project|human|human dna|human genome|human genome project|life|medical|people|project|understanding|understanding dna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3403,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,517,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",genetics-and-you,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2018-07-17 14:05:41",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3405,"Is there a fountain of youth?","Did you know that scientists say we have two ages? No, I am not talking about the one your driver’s license says you are (<em>the one some of us like to pretend we are</em>) – I'm talking about your <strong>chronological</strong> and <strong>biological</strong> ages. Your chronological age is the number of years you have been alive while your biological age refers to how old you <em>seem </em>to be. (Have you ever met someone and thought, “Wow I would never guessed she was 70!” or “Seriously, she’s only 45?”)

On the outside the age you seem to be could be influenced by the number of gray hairs or your head or lines on your face, the way you carry yourself or the way your body carries weight, your attitude toward new ideas or your willingness to embark on new adventures.

On the inside, an important indication of your age – how old you seem to be – is the length of your telomeres. Telomeres are the protective caps at the end of our chromosomes (imagine the plastic or metal coating on the ends of your shoelaces) that help them remain stable. As cells divide, the telomeres become shorter. As they become shorter, their structural integrity weakens (imagine frayed laces once that protective end is broken) and the cells age and die quicker. During the past decade or so research has linked shorter telomeres with a number of diseases related to aging, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and stroke.

Obviously, your biological age is very important. Chronological age? Not so much so. Sure, it was a big deal when you were younger. After all, it determined when you could get your driver’s license, buy alcohol, or vote. (It didn’t really matter how old you <em>seemed to be</em> when it came to those things.) But now – for the most part, at least – your chronological age is just a number. So if you’re caught in a rut of thinking a “50-year-old shouldn’t do that,” a “60-year-old could never do that” or “70 is way too late to start doing that,” get out of it now.

While you certainly can’t change your chronological age you <em>can </em>change your biological age. Research out of UC San Francisco suggests that through changes in lifestyle – exercising, eating healthfully, managing stress and having good social supports – you may actually lengthen telomeres – and your life. (See Chapter 2: “Counteracting Bad Habits” for more healthy lifestyle changes.) You can also change the age you seem to be, making yourself look, feel and act younger.

3411,"Drink Up! Water That Is.....","No road down Florida’s east coast is complete without a stop in historic St. Augustine and Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park. Located in the area first explored by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1513, the park features the remains of the first successful European settlement in the New World -- including what Ponce de Leon believed to be the elusive Fountain of Youth. When my family made that trip when I was young, my parents thought it would be educational for my brother and me to see the Spanish Lookout Tower and archaeological excavations in the oldest U.S. city. I, however, was more interested seeing the Fountain of Youth. Although intellectually I knew, even at a young age, there was no such thing as eternal youth, in my imagination I saw old people – <em>like 30 or something</em> – splashing in the fountain and drinking to their hearts’ contents. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered the fountain was a spring accessed by a well and the only drink we could take from it was lukewarm and in a paper cup.

What I didn’t realize at the time was how vital that spring’s water was to the survival of some our nation’s earliest settlers and how vital water is to our health and longevity today.

<strong>Consider these facts about water:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The average woman’s body is about 55 percent water. By the time we feel thirsty we have already we have already lost about 2 to 3 percent of our body’s water.</li>
 	<li>While humans can live up to three weeks (pretty miserable weeks, of course) without food, we will likely die within three days without water.</li>
 	<li>One-fifth of our body’s water is in blood plasma. It flows through the blood, carrying oxygen and nutrients to cells. Water also cushions our joints, protects our brains and helps regulate our body temperature.</li>
 	<li>Drinking water regularly helps flush our bodies of toxins, aids in digestion and even keeps our skin younger and healthier looking.</li>
</ul>
<strong>So how much water do you need? </strong>

Many experts suggest at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily (more in warm weather and if you are exercising). Others suggest there is no set requirement of water per day, but that you should always reach for water when you are thirsty, as any added ingredients will dilute the hydration benefits of pure H20. To ensure you are getting enough, take a look at your urine. If it is straw-colored or pale yellow, you are probably getting enough water. If it is a slightly darker yellow, you could stand to drink more. Darker urine – the color of amber or honey – means you are not getting enough water and need some right away. Very dark urine – the color of syrup or brown ale – could indicate severe dehydration or liver disease. Increase your water consumption and monitor your urine color. If it doesn’t lighten up, call your doctor.

Your water doesn’t need to come from a fabled fountain or fancy bottle to benefit you. In fact, I advise against buying bottled water. In many cases it is merely taken from a municipal source, probably no different from what comes from you tap. (Read the label.) Regardless of the source of the water inside, most of the bottles --perhaps more than 85 percent -- wind up in landfills. So do yourself and the environment a favor by filling your favorite to-go cup with your own well-filtered tap water, and drink up!

<strong>How to Ensure Healthy Tap Water</strong>

Want to know what’s in the water that comes from your tap? Under the ""right-to-know"" provisions in the drinking water law, all tap water suppliers must provide annual water quality reports to their customers. To obtain a copy, contact your water provider. If you’re concerned about impurities, buy a filter to attach to your tap. Better yet, if you can afford one – they are a bit pricy – have a high-quality water filtration system installed at the entry point of your water source to benefit from the highest purity level possible for all of your bathing, cooking and drinking water requirements.",,"2020-07-17 14:22:06",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/drink-up-water-that-is/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CHS-19-Baby-Boomer-Children-1024x585.jpg,CHS-19-Baby-Boomer-Children-1024x585,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CHS-19-Baby-Boomer-Children-1024x585.jpg,,Longevity,,"archaeological|body's water|color|de|de leon|drink|drinking|drinking water|fountain|fountain of youth|getting enough water|ponce|ponce de|ponce de leon|source|tap|tap water|urine|urine the color|youth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3412,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,26,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",drink-up-water-that-is,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:49:31",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3415,"9 Bad Habits You Need to Change Now","If you’ve taken a look in the mirror or glanced around the room at a recent class reunion it’s no secret how much our bodies change with age. Skin loses elasticity, leading to wrinkles and creases; fat storage shifts from the hips and thighs to the abdomen, causing our pear-or hour-glass-shaped bodies to more closely resemble a beach ball; and hair thins in some areas and crops up troublingly in others. And that’s just part of what’s visible on the outside.

There are also changes going on inside that we cannot see: bones lose density, blood vessels (which, like our skin, are made up of collage) become less supple; organs, including our kidneys and livers, function less efficiently; and our senses become less, well sensitive. We may not see, hear, smell or taste as keenly as we did when we were younger. Lots of other things don’t work as well as when we were younger either. Taking care of our bodies takes on a whole new importance. Bad habits you may have gotten away with when you were younger – eating poorly, skimping on sleep, spending long hours at a desk – may start to catch up with you.

The good news is that it is not too late to adopt new ones habits. Doing so may not only prevent further damage, but in some cases can help reverse the damage from less-than-wise choices.

Here are 9 habits you need to change now – and why.....

<strong>1. Overeating </strong>

If you were one of those teenagers or 20-somethings who could eat anything you wanted and still stay pencil thin (by the way, I never liked your type), you’ve probably discovered the endless smorgasbord comes at a price. Genetic factors, decreasing muscle mass, reduced activity levels and even lack of sleep (more about that shortly) can contribute to weight gain as you age – particularly after menopause.

Excessive weight is more than a nuisance that affects your appearance and prevents you from fitting in that little black dress or snapping your pants. Fat that accumulates around your midsection in particular produces hormones and other substances that can profoundly influence your health and puts you at risk for   a host of problems including diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.

Some women tell me they gain now just looking at food. While I certainly don’t think that is possible, looking at food can tempt you to take a bite, and sometimes taking just a bite – if you do it frequently enough – can start to pack on the pounds.

Suppose your friend is eating a Big Mac. Watching her savor those two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce and cheese – oh the cheese! – is more than your willpower can bear. She offers you a bite. At 560 calories for the entire burger, let’s say your bite has about 50 calories. No harm done. But what if she offered you a bite of her Big Mac (or something calorically comparable) every day for a year? By this time next year you would have consumed an extra 18,250 calories, which translates to a weight gain of more than five pounds – a big price to pay for just a bite!

The good news from this example is that losing weight is possible through small acts as well. Let’s say you are eating enough to maintain a stable weight. If you pass up the equivalent of a Big Mac bite each day, you could lose more than five pounds by next year – just by passing on one bite!

Right now I use the example of a Big Mac purely for its calorie content. We’ll get into the issue of nutrients good and bad shortly. But whether you are consuming too many calories from hamburgers and candy bars or from healthier more healthy choices like avocados and almond milk, the result is largely the same – weight gain. Therefore, overeating -- even if’s the good stuff -- is not good.

So what causes us to overeat and, more importantly, how we can stop doing it is an area that has intrigued researchers, including Brian Wansink, professor and director of the famed Cornell University Food and Brand Lab and author of <em>Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think. </em>Research by Wansink gives us this advice for limiting portion sizes.

<strong>Understand portion sizes:</strong> Sometime we eat large portions because we don’t know what constitutes a portion. When trying to measure portions, a good rule of thumb is to use your thumb – or the palm of your hand, or a domino. A one-ounce serving of peanut butter is approximately the size of your thumb, a 3-ounce serving of meat is about the size of your palm, and a one-ounce serving of cheese is about the size of domino.

<strong>Take it slow.</strong> If your rush though a plate of your favorite pasta dish, chances are you will want another. That’s because it takes a few minutes for your stomach to tell your brain that’s it full. By eating slowly, you will not only have more time to savor your favorite foods, but you will also reduce the desire to fill a second plate when one is enough.

<strong>Choose your plates wisely</strong>. The size and even the color of the plates can make a difference in how much you eat. If you use a small plate and fill it to the edge your brain will think you are eating more than if you place the same amount of food in the center of a large plate. And though it sounds crazy, you’ll eat less food if it’s served on plate that’s different in color from the food you are eating. In other words, no mashed potatoes or macaroni on white plates. Wansink says the higher the contrast between and plate the more you realize just how large your serving is.

<strong>Put it out of sight. </strong>Remember the Big Mac your friend was eating? Do you think you would have taken that bite if that burger if your friend had been eating it in another room – better yet, at her own house? Probably not. It was the sight of the Big Mac (probably along with the smell and your friend’s obvious enjoyment) that made you want it. In one study by Wansink women ate more candy from a clear dish than from an opaque dish that made the candy less visible to them. The take-home message: if you shouldn’t eat it, don’t have it where you can see it.

<strong>Pick small packages.</strong> It’s easy to overeat when there’s a lot in front of you to eat. Whether it’s a piece of fruit or a bag of chips, people tend to think of a single unit as a serving, so smaller units mean smaller servings and less chance of overeating. If you’d prefer not to spend extra on single-serving sizes or 100-calorie packs of packaged foods, buy a larger package and divide it into individual servings. When you are ready to eat, take one serving only and put the rest out of sight.

<strong>Avoid distractions.</strong> The more focused you are on something else – a TV show, a conversation at the next table – the less you are focused on what you are eating, which can cause you to eat more. One study even showed that women ate more when they sat at the table in a messy kitchen. So clean up the kitchen and focus on your food, and you’ll be more likely to eat less.

<strong>2. Eating junk food</strong>

I once worked with a woman for whom break time always meant a trip to the break room vending machines. One day as we continued a discussion that had begun at our desks, I watched as she dropped quarters into the machine. “What are you getting?” I asked, just before a package of crackers fell past a glass window in the machine. “Lunch,” she smiled. “Now it’s time to choose dessert,” eyeing a fair-sized chocolate chip cookie sealed in cellophane.

&nbsp;

I can’t say that my friend was overeating. In fact, her vending machine meal would have left a Chihuahua hungry. Nor was she consuming too many calories. With her package of crackers and cookie each weighing in at just under 200 calories – OK, I’m addicted to reading food labels, so I discretely looked! -- her meal had about half the calories of a turkey sandwich with Swiss at the deli next door. Yet what she was eating was just plain bad.

&nbsp;

While eating like my friend did is not likely to lead to weight gain, it can lead to other problems by subjecting your body to ingredients it doesn’t need while depriving it of nutrients it does.

&nbsp;

If you’re ready to give up a junk food habit, here are three ingredients you need to watch for as well as some tips to minimize or eliminate them.

&nbsp;

<strong>Trans fats</strong>

Many packaged foods, such as my friend’s vending machine lunch, contain trans fats. Trans fats may be natural or artificial. Natural trans fats are produced in the guts of some animals, and the meat and milk for these animals may contain them. Artificial trans fats, which are far more common, are produced through an industrial process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oils to make them solid. Food manufacturers use these trans fats (also referred to as partially hydrogenated oils) to increase the shelf life and improve the taste and texture of packaged foods. Many fast food restaurants use them to fry foods because they can be reused many times, making them an economical cooking method.

But trans fats also have a serious downside. They raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol and lower your HDL (good) cholesterol. Trans fat consumption is linked with increased risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made a preliminary determination that partially hydrogenated oils are no longer Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in human food.

&nbsp;

Trans fats are present in many products, including many fried foods and baked goods. To determine if and how much trans fats a food contains check the Nutrition Facts panel, which lists trans fats, or check the ingredient list for partially hydrogenated oils.

&nbsp;

To reduce or eliminate trans fat consumption, replace trans fats in your diet with healthy monounsaturated fats or polyunsaturated fats. Consume a diet that emphasizes whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, poultry, fish nuts and low-fat dairy products. Limit the amount of fried foods (like donuts and chicken nuggets) you eat as well as packaged baked goods like cookies, muffins and cakes. When cooking, use unhydrogenated vegetable oils such as safflower, sunflower, canola and olive oil.

&nbsp;

<strong>Sugars</strong>

Whether they go by the name high fructose corn syrup, sucrose or glucose, processed and refined sugars are everywhere. And while they tempt you with their sweetness they are not your friend.

&nbsp;

The massive amounts of refined sugars contained in the typical Western diet are designed to stimulate appetites and increase consumption, and they do a pretty good job of it. Approximately one third of all calories in the average American diet come from refined sugar and corn syrup.

&nbsp;

All of that sugar is associated with a lot of our most common health problems: obesity, kidney stones, tooth decay, diabetes, heart disease and diabetes, to name a few. Processed sugar also plays a role in the possible onset of insomnia, depression, hypertension, colon and pancreatic cancer, skin breakouts and metabolic syndrome. Refined sugar depletes the body of B vitamins and other nutrients, which can lead to indigestion and allergies. Research has even linked sugar to brain shrinkage and cognitive decline.

If you’d like to reduce the sugar in your diet, a good place to start is with soft drinks, the single largest source of refined sugar in the American diet. The average American consumes 53 gallons of soft drinks every year. The average can of soda has about 40 grams, or 10 teaspoons of sugar. One large 64-ounce soda contains approximately 53 teaspoons of sugar!

&nbsp;

The next time you are craving a cola, give one of the vast variety of herbal and natural teas a try. You may find that you can replace a soda craving with a flavor to suit every taste and mood, including fruit-infused varieties and others that ease stress. Consider adding a touch of lemon and natural honey or agave nectar instead of unhealthy sugar for sweetness or to soothe a dry or scratchy throat.

If you need a pick-me-up only caffeine can give you, choose coffee over soda. Coffee, in moderation, is actually considered beneficial to trigger the brain and aid in memory tasks. One caveat: in the afternoon, stick with decaf or you may find yourself restless and jittery at bedtime.

&nbsp;

For a sweet treat, look for naturally sweet foods like locally produced honey and ripe fruits such as dates and figs. Avoid long-term use of artificial sweeteners, as they too, have been linked with health problems. For a safe sugar alternative try stevia. Made from the stevia plant, it is void of calories or carbohydrates in its purest state. Stevia is available in several liquid and granule forms, under different brand names. If you’re looking for pure stevia, be sure to read the package, many products contain added ingredients to improve their shelf life.

&nbsp;

<strong>Salt</strong>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends limiting sodium consumption to 2,300 milligrams daily – or to no more than 1,500 mg daily if you have high blood pressure. If you regularly eat at fast food restaurants and/or prepare meals using processed and refined foods, there’s a good chance you’re consuming twice that limit -- as much as 3,500 to 5,000 milligrams daily. [<strong>Alexis, do you remember where you got this figure? It was in your book.]</strong>

Restaurants and snack food manufacturers add a lot of salt to foods because it is cheap way to make foods taste good and is habit forming. (Did you ever wonder why you couldn’t eat just one potato chip?) Bars serve salty snacks because they increase thirst and get you to buy more drinks.

But you’ll also find salt in less- expected places than bowls on bar counters and potato chip bags. Leading sources of sodium include canned vegetables, prepackaged cereals and frozen meals, even the ones that claim to be healthy.

If your taste buds are not as sensitive as they were when you were younger you may be tempted to shake on more salt – or you might not notice as much when foods are highly salty. But beware.

&nbsp;

Excessive salt consumption is a contributor to increased risk for heart attack and stroke. Scientists from the Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health now believe that eating too much salt contributed to 2.3 million deaths from heart attacks, strokes and other heart-related diseases throughout the world in 2010, representing 15 percent of all deaths due to these causes.

With a growing body of evidence positioned against the use of salt, it only makes sense to limit it and look for healthier flavor-enhancing alternatives, such as paprika and saffron, to reduce salt cravings.

&nbsp;

Ideally your diet should be low in all of these. But that doesn’t mean a healthy diet should always be about what you <em>can’t</em> eat. There are many delicious foods you should eat and nutrients you should add to your diet for health and longevity.

One of the main reasons I hear from women for not eating healthfully is that they have little incentive to cook or prepare healthy meals, particularly if they live alone. Others say their busy lives leave little time for cooking. After a long day it’s far too tempting to make a trip through a drive-thru or pop frozen entrées into the microwave.

&nbsp;

I recommend preparing your own frozen dinners. Pick one time a week – say Sunday afternoons – to prepare cook a few entrees. Better yet invite a friend or two to bring ingredients for a favorite meal to share and make it a party. Divide into individual freezable containers, label and place in the freezer for days when you don’t have the time or desire to cook. Just steam few vegetables to enjoy with your entrée and add fruit for dessert.

&nbsp;

Homemade frozen dinners are also great to take to work. Bring along some carrot sticks or a celery stick and a piece of fresh fruit to minimize temptations from the vending machine. It’s never too late – or too soon – to start eating healthfully.

 	<li><strong>Being sedentary</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

If a busy career and family life left little time for exercise, if you worked late into the evenings and had lunch at your desk, or if your interests leaned more toward sewing or keeping up with the soaps than gardening or playing tennis, your sedentary lifestyle could eventually catch up with you.

&nbsp;

A lack of physical activity has been linked to a wide range of health problems, including obesity, osteoporosis, cognitive decline, depression, increased susceptibility to infections, and increased risk of diabetes heart attack, stroke, breast and colon cancer.

&nbsp;

The good news: it’s not too late get active and start reaping the benefits of regular exercise. Not sure how much or what type of exercise you need? See Chapter 3: “Too Fit to Quit.”

&nbsp;

<strong>The even better news is that you don’t have to do marathon exercise sessions to benefit. If you can’t walk or jog for 30 minutes at a time, three 10-minute walks or jobs will be just fine</strong><strong>. </strong>In fact, if you haven’t been active in a while, it’s important to start slowly. It’s also a must to see your doctor before beginning a vigorous exercise program and be sure to check out Chapter 3: “Too Fit to Quit” to learn how regular exercise can benefit your body, mind and spirit and for guidelines on choosing the right exercise and amount of exercise for you.

 	<li><strong>Skimping on sleep</strong></li>
</ol>
We’ve all had our share of late or sleepless nights cramming for exams, partying with friends, working to meet a deadline or nursing a child. While an occasional night of little or no sleep may be inevitable, routinely skimping on sleep is a habit to be avoided.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately in our society, sleep deprivation is often viewed as a virtue (like passing up a slice of pie) or as a sign of dedication (burning the midnight oil to complete a project) or even genius (Thomas Jefferson reportedly slept only four to five hours nightly). In actuality, sleep time is more than a disruption to a busy day, and the need for sleep is not a sign of weakness. Adequate sleep is essential to our physical and mental health, productivity and safety.

&nbsp;

Sometimes the dangers of sleep deprivation can be felt instantly (such as crashing your car because you have dozed off or your reaction times were slowed), but more often they are insidious, as long-term sleep loss contributes to problems such as heart disease, obesity and diabetes.

&nbsp;

Why? According to the Heart Blood and Lung Institute it is during sleep that our bodies heal and repair of tissues including the heart and blood vessels. Sleep also maintains the balance of hormones that make you feel hungry (ghrelin) or full (leptin).   When you don't get enough sleep, your ghrelin level goes up and your leptin level goes down. As a result you feel hungrie than you would after a good night’s sleep.

<a href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why"">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why</a>

&nbsp;

Sleep also affects how your body reacts to insulin, the hormone that controls your blood glucose (sugar) level. When you don’t get enough sleep your blood sugar levels rise, which may increase your risk for diabetes.

&nbsp;

Sleep is also important to the health of your immune system and its ability to defend you against infection. It’s no coincidence when you come down with a cold or flu after a period of sleep deficiency. And when you do, inadequate sleep can make it harder for your body to fight infections.

&nbsp;

What exactly is adequate sleep? The answer differs to a degree depending on your age. According to the National Sleep Foundation, adults 26 to 64 need 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night to maintain good health and mental focus. For those 65 and older, the range goes down to 7-8 hours nightly, but still more than most people in that age group get. <strong>[Alexis, new figures from the National Sleep Foundation: </strong><a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need/page/0/2""><strong>https://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need/page/0/2</strong></a><strong>]</strong>

&nbsp;

If you’re having a hard time getting the sleep you need, the Foundation offers these tips to boost your sleep mood and send you off to dreamland sooner.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Stick to a schedule.</strong> Practice going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, even on vacations and weekends. This helps regulate and program your body’s internal clock for sleep.</li>
 	<li><strong>Avoid cigarettes and tobacco products.</strong> They are not good for you under any circumstances, but if you need another reason to avoid them, they disrupt sleep.</li>
 	<li><strong>Eliminate afternoon and evening caffeine.</strong> The caffeine in coffee, tea, many soft drinks and even chocolate is a stimulant that can interfere with sleep. For an afternoon slump, reach for a healthy snack of yogurt or nuts. If you’re accustomed to an evening cup of coffee or tea, try caffeine-free versions. Having a cup of herbal tea, such as chamomile, before bedtime can help relieve stress and relax your muscles.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep your windows covered. </strong>Layer your bedroom windows with functioning treatments, such as traversing draperies and operable blinds that can block out light when a daytime sleep-in is called for, and provide extra insulation during weather extremes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Silence the phone. </strong>Resist the urge to leave your cell phone bedside, unless it is part of your security plan, and consider muting the ringer to avoid unwanted wake-up calls.</li>
 	<li><strong>Turn off the TV.</strong> While enjoying the entertainment value it offers in the privacy of your bedroom is appealing, try to avoid depending on the TV as a crutch to help you fall asleep. Instead, opt for listening to soft, instrumental music to relax your mind at bedtime.</li>
 	<li><strong>Get exercise.</strong> A good workout in the day can promote sleep at night, but be careful complete workouts at least 3 hours before bedtime. Any later and they can leave you stimulated and unable to sleep.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep your room cool.</strong> Avoid turning up the thermostat at bedtime, as resting body temperatures require less heat and will relax better in a room that is dark, cool and comfortable. The ideal temperature: between 60 and 67 degrees.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take an old fashioned approach.</strong> Although it may seem old fashioned, a glass of warm milk and a warm bath at bedtime can encourage slumber.</li>
 	<li><strong>Avoid sleep aids</strong>. Avoid antihistamine-containing over-the-counter sleep aids except for occasional use, if your doctor recommends them. Although they may make you drowsy and induce sleep they do not address the cause of sleeplessness and they carry the risk of side effects including blurred vision, dizziness, dry mouth and constipation. A better choice: melatonin, a hormone made by your brain’s pineal gland that helps control sleep and wake cycles, and is available as a dietary supplement.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

If you’re getting the required number of sleep hours – or at least think you are – and still waking up feeling unrefreshed or feeling sleepy throughout the day, you may be suffering from sleep apnea, a condition in which your breathing stops repeatedly throughout the night, causing you to you to awaken. Be sure to mention it the next time you see your doctor. An evaluation may be in order and treatment is available.

 	<li><strong>Being careless with oral care</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

Having a dirty mouth has nothing to do with using language that would make your mother ashamed. All of our mouths are full of bacteria and other ugly bugs, collecting on our teeth in a sticky film called plaque and waiting to wreak havoc. Unless you are diligent about brushing and flossing the bacterial will use sugars in the foods you eat to produce acids that will eat away at your tooth enamel causing cavities.

&nbsp;

Plaque that is not removed eventually forms tartar, a harder-to-remove substance that can collect at the gum line and cause gingivitis -- gums that are red, swollen and prone to bleeding when you brush. Uncontrolled gingivitis can further progress to periodontitis, a condition where bacteria in the mouth invade the structures that support teeth, leading to the breakdown of gum tissue and underlying bone and eventually tooth loss.

&nbsp;

If that’s not enough to have you rushing to find a flosser, the effects of periodontal disease are not confined to your ability to comfortably chew foods or smile; bacteria that enter the bloodstream through your gums can travel to other parts of the body, setting off an inflammatory response that could potentially cause of a wide range of problems from increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease to worsening inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

&nbsp;

There is even some evidence that the bacteria cause periodontitis, including <em>Streptococcusmutans</em>, <em>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</em>, <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis, can be passed</em> through intimate oral contact or the sharing of drinking cups and silverware. So for the sake of your smile, your health and that of your romantic partners, it is important to take good care of your mouth.

&nbsp;

If you haven’t always been faithful about flossing, now is the time to start, using dental floss or tape once a day. If you find it difficult to floss prefer something a little more high tech, try an oral irrigator (you’re likely to know them by the name WaterPik). Oral irrigators have been shown to clean between the teeth and below the gum line. Research suggests that when combined with brushing, oral irrigators not only remove plaque but may also reduce inflammatory substances in the gum tissue.

&nbsp;

Also consider the benefits of adding oil-pulling to your oral care routine. Oil pulling involves gently swishing about a tablespoon of coconut and sesame oil around in the mouth, usually for 10 to 20 minutes per day. The premise is that the fatty cell membranes of the bacteria in the mouth adhere to the oils. When you spit out the oil, the harmful bacteria go with it. Oil pulling is not only super trendy, but it has a long track record – it’s a type of Ayurvedic medicine that dates back 3,000 years.

&nbsp;

If your dentist recommends it, use a fluoride rinse – either prescription or over-the-counter --to strengthen tooth enamel.

&nbsp;

Speaking of your dentist, it may be time you started seeing more of him or her. Even if you have been faithful about twice yearly checkups and cleanings it may be wise to increase their frequency and perhaps intensity. If you have signs of periodontal disease, your dentist may recommend root scaling and planing, a procedure that involves scaling the plaque, bacteria and toxins from the tooth and root surfaces and then smoothing the rough areas on root surfaces. It’s a little more unpleasant than a typical cleaning, but for many people it helps improve the health of the roots and gum tissues so that no further specific treatment is necessary.

&nbsp;

Even if your teeth and gums are in tip top shape regular oral checkups and cleaning can help keep them that way. They also allow your dentist to detect lesions or other changes in the mouth that could be early indicators of cardiovascular disease and stroke.

&nbsp;

In short, don’t be careless with oral care -- there are probably more reasons that you ever realized to take care of your mouth.

<ol start=""6"">
 	<li><strong>Drinking too much</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

For many of my friends in college, drinking was a primary source of entertainment. Although most of us have probably drunk more than we should have on at least a few occasions, excessive drinking is never good. Short term it can land you in a ditch, a jail cell, or worse. Long term, excessive use of alcohol can lead to serious health problems, and as we age that risk increases.

&nbsp;

More than 15 million people in the U.S. abuse or overuse alcohol, and a shockingly-large percentage of those - over 90% -- develop fatty livers. The earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease, alcoholic fatty liver disease results from the deposition of fat in the liver cells. Signs and symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, discomfort in the right upper abdomen and elevated liver enzymes. If you have fatty liver disease you may be able to reverse it by giving up alcohol. If you continue to drink to excess it may progress to alcoholic hepatitis, which is inflammation and mild scarring of the liver, or cirrhosis, a condition in which scar tissue replaces healthy tissue interfering with the liver’s normal function. Although you can’t reverse cirrhosis by abstaining from alcohol you may be able to improve it and prevent further damage.

&nbsp;

In addition to liver disease, problems associated with excessive alcohol use include inflammation of the pancreas, weight gain, malnutrition, nervous system damage, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalances, problems with concentration, elevated blood lipid levels, inflammation of the heart, some cancers, depression and increased suicide risk.

&nbsp;

Despite the dangers of too much alcohol, there is a growing body of evidence that there is no harm in having an occasional or even a regular drink. In fact research suggests that moderate drinking – defined as one to three drinks per day for women -- is associated with lower mortality rates (the risk of dying). Especially when the beverage choice is red wine, alcohol is thought to improve heart health, circulation and sociability.

&nbsp;

If you want to include alcohol in your diet, moderation is the key. Precede your drink with at least 8 to 16 ounces of water for hydration (alternately sipping a cocktail and glass of water can help you drink less to too). Drinking with a meal can help your body process the alcohol.

&nbsp;

Before you decide to add alcohol to your next meal, get the facts about how much and which type of alcohol you should avoid (a great source of info is www.drinkaware.co.uk). Check your wine's ABV (alcohol by volume) to track how strong it is and what percentage of the drink is made up of alcohol. For example, wine with 12% ABV is 12% pure alcohol. Avoid wines with a high ABV percentage of 18% or more to minimize the negative impacts of alcohol in your system.

&nbsp;

If you regularly exceed the recommended alcohol intake of 3 drinks per day for women (a drink equates to approximately three regular bottles of standard 5 percent beer) or 14 drinks per week, seek out the advice of a qualified professional.

&nbsp;
<ol start=""7"">
 	<li><strong>Smoking</strong></li>
</ol>
While smoking once may have made you look or feel cool, today it just makes you look old. Smoking tobacco damages the delicate skin under your eyes, causes unsightly bags; decreases blood flow to the skin, causing premature aging and wrinkles, stains your teeth and fingernails and increases your risk of periodontal disease and subsequent tooth loss.

&nbsp;

Inside your body the picture is no prettier. Have you ever seen the pictures comparing the lungs of smokers and non smokers? While the non-smokers’ lungs are vibrant pink or red, the smokers lungs appear charred or are covered with black spots or holes.

&nbsp;

The results of smoking’s internal damage can be lung disease, including lung cancer and emphysema; cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

&nbsp;

Unless you have spent the last half century in a remote jungle, the dangers of smoking probably come as no surprise to you. What might surprise you is how much quitting can help, and it’s (almost) never too late to reap some of the benefits of kicking butt, so to speak.

&nbsp;

Research shows an overwhelming amount of damage to your health can be reversed by quitting. While the greatest benefits in those who stop young (quitting around age 30 reduces the chance of dying from smoking-related diseases by more than 90 percent), if you quit at 50 or 60 you can still reduce your risk of premature death compared to those who continue smoking.

&nbsp;

Not only will quitting increase your chances of living longer, it will also bring benefits to the years you gain. And some of those benefits can be felt almost immediately – as many as 20 minutes after you quit.

&nbsp;

Consider these benefits according to Partnership for a Tobacco-Free Maine:

&nbsp;

Immediately . . .

your heart rate and blood pressure will begin to return to normal.

&nbsp;

Within a few hours . . .

your body’s level of carbon monoxide, which decreases the blood’s ability to carry oxygen, will begin to decline.

&nbsp;

Within a few weeks . . .

your circulation improves, you produce less phlegm and you cough or wheeze less often; your heart function improves; food tests better; your sense of smell returns to normal; everyday activities no longer leave you out of breath.

&nbsp;

Within several months . . .

your lung function improves significantly.

&nbsp;

In one year . . .

your risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke is cut in half.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In five years. . .

your risk for many kind of cancer, including lung, larynx, mouth, stomach, cervix and bladder, decreases. Your risk may now be similar to that of someone who has never smoked.

&nbsp;

Within 10 to 15 years . . .

your risk of lung disease is decreased; many medical conditions – including cataracts, macular degeneration, thyroid conditions and osteoporosis, are positively affected; medications may work better, making it possible to take to take some in decreased doses.

&nbsp;

Quitting smoking can also save you money. Even if you smoke just two packs a week at an average of $6 a pack (the actual price varies greatly depending on the excise tax in the state where your purchase them), you could save $624 next year on the price of cigarettes alone.

&nbsp;

If you purchase your own health insurance as opposed to having insurance provided by an employer, you can save far more than that on your insurance premiums.   Under the Affordable Care Act, smokers can be charged up to 50 percent more on their health insurance premiums. That means if a monthly premium would have been $1000 (which sadly is modest policy for a woman in her late 50s ) your premium as a smoker could and additional $500 monthly or an extra $6000 annually.

&nbsp;

While nicotine addiction can be one of the toughest addictions to beat, there are plenty of incentives, both health wise and money wise, to give it your best try. And there is help -- in the form of devices, medications and programs –out there for those who seek it. One of benefit of health insurance plans offered on exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act is that they cover smoking cessation treatment with no coinsurance and no copayment. Take advantage while you can and give yourself the gift of better health, a healthier appearance and quite likely a longer life.

&nbsp;

<ol start=""8"">
 	<li><strong>Sun worshipping</strong></li>
</ol>
If you grew up in the ‘50s or ‘60s your beach or pool gear may have consisted of baby oil and a “double album” (remember those?) covered in foil to intensify the sun’s rays on your face – yikes!

&nbsp;

While you likely have weathered skin to show for it, consider yourself fortunate if wrinkles and creases are the only signs of your sun worship.   Exposure to ultraviolet rays in the single most important factor in the development of skin cancers, which can be disfiguring or even deadly.

&nbsp;

There are three main types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. The prognosis depends largely on the type. Basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer, is also the most treatable. Melanoma, the least common, is the most dangerous. Like all cancers, skin cancers are most treatable are least likely to damage the surrounding tissues when found and treated early.

While you can’t reverse the effect of all of those years of sunbathing, you can minimize their appearance. More importantly you can take steps to prevent future damage and reduce your risk of developing skin cancers. Trade in your baby oil for a broad spectrum sunscreen and your foil-covered White Album for a wide-brimmed hat.   Avoid the sun during the hours you may have once regarded as peak tanning hours – roughly 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Report any suspicious skin changes – a mole that changes shape or color, a blemish that bleeds and doesn’t heal – to your doctor, and have regular screens by your family doctor or a dermatologist to check for signs or areas that you may have missed. Next to prevention, early detection and treatment is your best defense.

&nbsp;
<ol start=""9"">
 	<li><strong>Skipping screenings </strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

Speaking of screenings, keeping up with them at every age is important. As a young woman, your recommended screenings consisted for the most part of a Pap test every three years, an annual breast exam to check for lumps and twice yearly dental checkups. But as you age and your risk of different health problems increases, so does the number of different screenings you need.

These include mammograms every one to two years starting at age 40, a fasting plasma glucose test (for diabetes) every three years starting at 45, a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 50, and a bone density test at age 65. Screenings allow your doctor to check for signs medical problems before they cause you symptom. For most problems the sooner you detect them and start treatment the better the outcome.

&nbsp;

Most health insurance policies now cover routine screening tests with no copayment, so there is really no reason not to keep up with them.

&nbsp;

To find a complete list of screenings (and immunizations) recommended for women, visit healthywomen.org. Then speak with your doctor about the tests and frequency that are right for you.

3418,"Does Love Really Matter?","Who better to age with than the love of your life? If your mate is also your best friend, even better! Couples that are mutually endowed with long life can benefit from the emotional, mental, physical and financial support that comes from a long-term commitment.

Long-term relationships and marriages start out with the best of intentions and are usually defined by romance, passion and commitment. Recognizing that there are <a href=""http://www.foryourmarriage.org/stages-of-growth-in-marriage/"">distinct stages of growth</a> necessary for a successful marriage may be the ticket to celebrating your golden years together. After settling into the routine of a happy marriage, the reality-of-life stage takes over and personality differences emerge. Couples that get past the usual conflicts that can arise long after exchanging vows tend to focus more on their common ground, and don’t sweat the differences. We all know that marriage is about give and take. A successful commitment also requires trust, honesty and the ability to forgive each other for past mistakes. After decades of surviving through highs and lows, such as sickness, financial concerns, and family conflicts, a relationship built on mutual respect has a solid foundation to succeed through every stage, including the final farewell.

Whether you are a newlywed or celebrating your golden anniversary, the basics remain the same. <a href=""http://firstthings.org/retirement-and-marriage"">Retirement and marriage</a> doesn’t always sync up as easily as love and marriage did in the beginning of your relationship and may require a period of adjustment. Without proper planning, it can turn into the relationship from hell that ends in divorce court.

Give your spouse or significant other the gift of space and time to adjust to a major lifestyle change, such as retirement. Honey-do lists and personal agendas should not define the start of retirement and can certainly wait a few months. Retirement timetables may not always be in total sync, as often one spouse exits the job market several months or years before the other. View the transitions as stair steps to testing the waters and preparing the boat for the dual journey ahead.

Avoid the onset of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1021891/?page=1"">retired husband syndrome</a>, a recognized affliction that can disrupt the daily routine and order in a household and manifest in the form of physical and mental distress for some stay-at-home wives (I am quite sure it applies to stay at home husbands as well!). When spouses are unaccustomed to spending countless hours together, they sometimes encounter gaps in communication and intimacy - two important building blocks of a relationship. This can be exasperated when a husband with decades of bread-winning behind him experiences a dramatic shift in his daily schedule that may leave many weekdays open with no specific destination or reason to venture out of the house. Suddenly thrust into full-time, domestic life, a retired spouse may create additional work just by hanging out, while remaining oblivious to the extra mess he creates in the process, and thereby cause stress levels to rise within the household. Left unchecked, this type of scenario can sometimes lead to illness, conflicts and possible divorce.

The Population Bureau <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2011/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx"">reports</a> that “Although older women today are more likely to be married than they were 50 years ago, they are still much less likely to be married than their male counterparts. Among the population ages 65 and older, about three quarters of men, but less than half (44 percent) of women were married in 2010.” With more professional women leaving the active job market than ever before, this trend will probably continue.

To avoid the onset of conflict that comes with spending endless days and nights under the same roof, make a plan to share the brunt of domestic chores. Evaluate the household duties, such as yard work, cooking and cleaning to re-distribute lopsided chores that were performed with habitual ease throughout active career schedules, and which may require a revamp to accommodate less-demanding lifestyles and less-nimble bodies.

Since retirement is supposed to be fun, take the calendar out once a month to strategize enjoyable activities that give equal consideration to the individuals, as well as combined preferences, and strive to include several family-centered events in the itinerary. Separate vacations once in a while may help ease the confinement of too many hours spent under the same roof together while giving the relationship breathing room to appreciate each other’s absence.

The plus side of staying together for a lifetime is immeasurable. Besides offering emotional support through life’s tragedies, including sickness and the death of loved ones, the lingering effects are less painful when shouldered with a spouse. Marriages that stand the test of time through raising families and beyond are positioned to reap the benefits of their long-term commitment. Double-income families create double-income retirement and pension funds which can translate into living upgrades and more frequent travels.

By developing a watchdog approach for each other, longevity becomes a mutual goal for long-term success. Develop new habits with a buddy-system approach that keeps you both on track for fitness and diet goals. Watch for early signs of disease that your spouse may not easily notice, such as <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/tc/sleep-apnea-symptoms"">sleep apnea</a> or other sleep-related disorders, and become pro-active toward each other’s good health.

Discuss the changing landscape of the aging process with your spouse to ease the transition for both of you. Communication levels are triggered by <a href=""http://www.spousetime.com/quality-time-with-spouse.html"">sharing quality time</a> and meals together. For instance, breakfast is the perfect setting to mark the day’s beginning, plan trips, discuss current events and offer upbeat, emotional support for personal issues, such as fading eyesight and receding hairlines.

It’s an often-held belief that sex is a by-product of a fertile mind. Intimacy comes in many forms, including spooning beneath the blanket and giving each other mutual massages and back rubs. Physical contact keeps couples connected with empathetic hugs and shoulder squeezes that offer unspoken affirmation of the ‘<em>you’re okay – I’m okay’</em> validation we all appreciate. Aging well together includes a gradual shift in the closeness and intimacy levels that may have once defined your marriage.

Love takes on new meaning in later life, including the frequency of lovemaking. Although the fireworks may not go off every night, older couples can still ignite the fires of passion with great satisfaction. To maintain a healthy <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/iage/201304/sex-in-older-age"">sex life</a>, sync up your libido with your spouse and go for quality over quantity by arranging romantic trysts in your candlelit bedroom or perhaps by checking into a luxury hotel. Focus on each other’s good qualities and ignore the rest.

The key to longevity for most people is to remain happy and optimistic and enjoy the company you keep on a regular basis. Researchers in the Journal of Marriage and Family agree that when the happiness factor is present, basic needs, such as proper sleep and healthy diet become a natural component of couple longevity. Their findings offer proof that <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyadvice/10161482/Couples-who-do-not-argue-live-longer-study-finds.html"">couples who don't argue</a> live longer and happier lives.

3422,"Lowering the Risk of Disease","Beyond the obvious reasons for remaining physically active, there’s even more to consider if you are serious about increasing your odds toward longevity. Aerobic exercise can influence whether the genes for heart disease, diabetes, or other illnesses are activated. If one of your parents has had a heart attack, you have a 30% chance of also having one – research tells us a consistent exercise regimen may combat some of those odds.

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has specific guidelines that outline the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/health/index.html"">benefits of physical activity</a>, which includes controlling your weight, reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome (indicated by thickening around the waist), high blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol and high blood sugar. Research shows that lower rates of these conditions are seen with a minimum of between 2 to 2-1/2 hours per week of at least moderate-intensity aerobic activity. And the more physical activity you do, the lower your risk will be.

Being physically active also lowers your risk for both colon and breast cancer. Some findings suggest that your risk of endometrial cancer and lung cancer may be also be lowered if you get regular physical activity compared to people who are not active.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xz2NhQiD6SQ?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Aerobics, muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening physical activity of at least a moderately-intensity level can slow the loss of bone density that comes with age. Osteoporosis and bone fractures are serious health conditions that can have life-changing negative effects, but your chances can be minimized by committing to at least 120 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week. Include balance and muscle-strengthening activities each week along with moderate-intensity aerobic activity to help reduce your risk of falling.

Regular workouts also help with arthritis and other conditions affecting the joints. With across- the-board, positive results, including reduced blood pressure, lower cortisol levels, and increased joint flexibility - which is beneficial for alleviating the chronic pains of arthritis, it’s not a big leap to nickname fitness the <em>fountain of youth</em>. Your brain power can also improve through aerobic exercise – specifically cognitive function such as task completion, selective attention, and memory. Physical activity can also reduce your risk of depression and may enhance regular sleep cycles. Include balance and muscle-strengthening activities each week along with moderate-intensity aerobic activity to help reduce your risk of falling.

The bottom line is that exercise and most physical activity can reduce your risk of dying early from major causes of death like heart disease and some cancers

If you’re new to exercise or need to adapt a new exercise plan that corresponds with your individual fitness level, it’s important that you choose the right workout that provides the correct balance of stretching, toning, resistance and cardio activities. Check with local community centers and fitness gyms to see what types of classes they offer to complement your fitness level. Start with small steps and don’t try to jump start an engine that may be out of tune. And it can’t be overstated that you should always check with your doctor before beginning an exercise regimen.",,"2020-07-17 14:38:51",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/lowering-the-risk-of-disease/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/f279e583-a70c-4c34-8dcf-e1e3206936d4.jpg,f279e583-a70c-4c34-8dcf-e1e3206936d4,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/f279e583-a70c-4c34-8dcf-e1e3206936d4.jpg,,Longevity,,"activity|activity to help|activity to help reduce|aerobic activity|aerobic activity to help|aerobic activity to help reduce|aerobic exercise|balance and muscle-strengthening|balance and muscle-strengthening activities|help reduce your risk|include balance and muscle-strengthening|include balance and muscle-strengthening activities|moderate-intensity aerobic|moderate-intensity aerobic activity|moderate-intensity aerobic activity to help|physical activity|physically active|reduce your risk|reduce your risk of falling|risk of falling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3423,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",lowering-the-risk-of-disease,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:49:19",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3426,"The 411 on Environmental Toxins","Environmental toxicity is a worldwide issue that does not acknowledge national or political restrictions. For example, Japan has encountered a phenomenon referred to as ""yellow sands"" in the last several years. This is brought on by polluting of the environment blowing in from Chinese industrial facilities over the Sea of Japan. Air pollution is a serious factor in many over-crowded cities, like Hong Kong. Nowadays there are over 1460 metric tons of airborne poisons traveling all over the world. Which means there may not be any location left on our planet that may be spared the consequences.

The future of global air quality is still an unknown, as the burning of fossil fuels continue to dominate our ozone layer. In 2005, Chicago encountered 68 days when the air quality was considered too harmful for kids, seniors and the chronically ill. Coal-fired power plants spew substances, such as sulfates, nitrates and mercury into the atmosphere. The oil industry has not eased up in the quest for more of the black stuff, and is gearing up for even more exploration with their increased fracking activity on American soil.

There are approximately 7 million health problems and 1000 fatalities every year in the USA States from water-borne microorganisms. Chlorinated chemicals and toxic compounds in city drinking water are already associated with sickness and health problems around the world. Chlorinated chemical substances in waters coming from inorganic pesticides, herbicides and chemicals are associated with enhanced risk of breast and other types of cancers. And yes, the pesticides are being applied to the food we eat in order to increase production and sustain profitability.

Environmentally harmful toxins also find a way into our fish and other seafood sources. By 2005, 47 states have released advisories to restrict consumption of freshwater seafood because of mercury toxic contamination. The FDA noted discovering chlorinated inorganic pesticides, such as DDE (a breakdown product of DDT), in 63% of foods researched and have been linked to many types of cancer.

It’s obvious that food, chemical, air and drug toxicity are controversial topics, as the struggle between corporate profits and consumer health continues to draw new battle lines and attract more warriors. With the myriad of toxins we’re exposed to in modern society, we’re faced with an increasing burden of unnatural substances that invade our bodies - from pesticides, herbicides and fungicides to air and water pollution, mercury, arsenic and other heavy metals in our food, and the list goes on.

Although the global toxicity issues are insurmountable, there is always hope through awareness and changing attitudes that slowly extend up to the corporate level to replace profits with purpose. Executives with a lens focused on the future have already positioned their companies to spread the green news with products that promote recycling and reduce the use of plastics and other environmentally-harmful products. Although the United States is still dragging its feet on Monsanto’s corporately-backed, genetically modified food-awareness issues, other countries, such as Mexico, are halting the growth of <a href=""http://www.naturalnews.com/042660_Mexico_GMO_corn_genetically_engineered_food.html"">GMO corn</a>, with many others lining up to dump the Frankenstein of the food industry.

Adopt a <a href=""http://www2.epa.gov/learn-issues/learn-about-greener-living"">green living</a> approach within your immediate environment, such as applying good recycling habits to your daily lifestyle. There are definite advantages in growing some of your own food with an organic or <a href=""http://howtohydroponics.com/"">hydroponic</a> method that delivers the maximum amount of nutrients to your kitchen table under a controlled growing environment that is free of pathogens, foreign chemicals and pollutants. If you’re new to gardening, start small with an indoor lettuce or herb-growing container and watch your thumb turn green with delight. Like everything else, become your own advocate of good health and stay up-to-date on changes that directly affect your life.",,"2020-07-17 14:45:39",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/the-411-on-environmental-toxins/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/toxins.gif,toxins,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/toxins.gif,,Longevity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3427,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",the-411-on-environmental-toxins,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:49:04",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3429,"Moving From High to Low Impact","Although high-impact sports and activities burn more calories than low-impact ones, there’s also an increased chance for injury associated with the fast-paced approach. The amount of impact that may occur on aging joints, knees, hips and other body parts with regular high-impact activities can be magnified to severe levels if left unchecked.

If you’re near sixty years old and you’ve maintained your stamina through years of high-impact activity, such as regular tennis matches or distance running in marathons, it’s time to think about scaling back to shorter and fewer events and opt for those that occur during the mildest weather months to preserve your joints. A gradual shift from high to low-impact activity is the best approach, since your body has become accustomed to regular aerobic activity and will respond better to a gentle and slow transition to preserve your overall endurance levels.

Supplement the activity with some quality pool time or sign up for an aquatics aerobics class to keep the blood flowing with a comfortable series of laps, strokes and breathing techniques that give the body a gentle and rejuvenating workout. A low-impact fitness program or class is another way to transition from high-impact activities that spawn minor aches and pains or leave you out of breath. Here are a few that are worth considering.

<strong>Pilates</strong> - Originally designed to give dancers muscle strength without bulk, Pilates was largely ignored by the general public for almost a century. With a growing acceptance by gyms, almost 40% of facilities offer Pilates as a regular exercise class. Pilates is a body conditioning system made up of various exercises that help mature adults build strength by improving flexibility, agility and economy of motion. Pilates can even help alleviate chronic ailments and back pain – all without building excess bulk. It has also been noted that with this type of fitness program there is often a marked improvement in posture and an increase in joint stability.

<strong>Yoga</strong> - The 5,000-year-old stretching and relaxation techniques in the yoga/tai chi category boasts over 11 million followers, almost double the 5.7 million who participated in 1998. It is an ideal way for mature adults to maintain a fitter body, calmer mind and feel more relaxed. Studies have shown that Yoga can normalize your blood pressure and even balance your nervous system all while using breathing techniques to cleanse your air passages; this cleansing also helps mature adults prevent respiratory ailments.

<strong>Elliptical Trainers and Recumbent Bikes</strong> - More than 10 million Americans currently use elliptical trainers, a knee-friendly cross between a stair climber and a cross-country-ski machine. That’s a surge of 177% over the 1998 level of 3.9 million — and a sign that elliptical trainers have passed the litmus test of health club acceptance. More than 10 million Americans now recline while they pedal using recumbent bikes, an increase of about 50% since 1998. Not only are these machines more comfy than ordinary exercise bikes for mature adults, they also alleviate considerable amounts of stress off achy lower backs.

<strong>Tai Chi</strong> – This ancient Chinese martial arts program is said to help mature adults improve their balance and potentially avoid falls. According to Mayo Clinic research one of out every three adults 65+ is involved in an accident resulting in a fall. The slow, gentle and soothing movements of Tai Chi help older adults develop stronger muscles, improve balance control, enhance concentration and stabilize psychological well-being. The movements and philosophy of Tai Chi also teach one to relax, slow down, coordinate the mind and body and improve posture.

By paying attention to your body’s subtle clues, you’ll be able to recognize the signs that point to slowing down your pace. Scale down your workout incrementally so your body will adjust to the changes while retaining muscle tone.

<a href=""http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/tipsandtricks/a/Cross_Training.htm"">Cross-training</a> will also ease the transition from high to low impact, by working both ends toward a favorable middle ground. In doing so, you maximize the benefits of high-impact workouts, like better bone density, while minimizing your chance of sprains and other injuries. When combining both high and low-impact repetitions throughout the workout, monitor your vital signs and any pain associated with your cross-training routine to determine where the line of demarcation needs to be drawn.

Another way to even the odds is with a <a href=""http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/burns-fat-faster-lowimpact-cardio-highimpact-10492.html"">low-impact cardio workout</a>, which keeps the heart rate elevated, a necessary component to burning calories. For every pound of fat that you plan to lose, you will need to burn 3,500 more calories than you eat. Exercises that are high intensity burn more calories in the same amount of time than low-intensity exercises do. However, you can adjust your own level of intensity, whether performing low or high impact movements, which ultimately determines the amount of calories you will burn. It’s helpful to monitor your heart rate before, during and after any type of workout in order to adequately maintain your target aerobic zone – a necessary component for burning fat.

Depending on how fit you are(Read about <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/fitness-over-fifty/"">Fitness over fifty</a>) , it can take between ten to thirty minutes of moderate exercise to experience an endorphin rush in the brain. This process enhances the immune system while promoting the natural chemical reaction to treat depression and anxiety and for general brain health. It is important to deliver a healthy level of aerobic activity to your brain, since it plays a part in the delivery of blood, oxygen and nutrients to every cell in the body.",,"2020-07-17 14:52:23",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/moving-from-high-to-low-impact/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/yjlive-bow-pose.jpg,yjlive-bow-pose,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/yjlive-bow-pose.jpg,,Longevity,,"activity|adults|aerobic activity|body|breathing techniques|burn more calories|elliptical trainers|fitness program|heart rate|help mature|help mature adults|high-impact|high-impact activities|low-impact|mature|mature adults|necessary component|recumbent bikes|tai chi|workout",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3430,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,26,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",moving-from-high-to-low-impact,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:48:44",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3433,"New Technology in the Fitness Space","You may not think there is much of a connection between <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2012/apr12/04-04msexergamerspr.aspx"">Microsoft</a> and fitness, but in Los Angeles, a partnership has been forged with the Partners in Care Foundation, the City of Los Angeles and the St. Barnabas Senior Services to improve the fitness levels of area seniors with the creation of “<a href=""http://www.heartlightonline.com/exergamers-wellness-club/"">The Exergamers Wellness Club</a>” This innovative program emphasizes mental, physical and social well-being of the seniors that participate in interactive gaming and online tracking of their health status. Microsoft plans to extend the program to many more senior centers while proving that technology has the ability to transform lives. Part of the program’s success is attributed to the use of Microsoft <a href=""https://www.healthvault.com/us/en""><em>HealthVault</em></a>, where seniors monitor their increased activity and have the option to track their personal health information, such as blood pressure and blood-glucose levels, and even share their online personal health information with family members or other caregivers. Seniors at St. Barnabas compete in virtual bowling tournaments with contemporaries across the country. They also dance to music ranging from hip-hop to disco using Kinect.

Microsoft is not the only game in town when it comes to interactive gaming experiences. Gamers of all ages appreciate the latest innovations in home gaming systems which offers a wide range of programs with action-packed virtual activities such as archery, water sports, and aerobic dance that can be accessed through your television screen.

Stay up-to-date on the latest innovations in fitness technology and smart phone apps to help you <a href=""http://experiencelife.com/article/fitness-technology-3-ways-to-work-out-smarter-than-ever/"">work out smarter</a> by tracking your vitals throughout the process. Even grownups like a new toy once in a while. Why not reward your workout efforts with a state-of-the-art <a href=""http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/best-fitness-gadgets/"">sensor technology</a> gadget that’s a little bit geeky and super cool for checking your vitals and delivering your favorite tunes through tiny ear buds that also act as sensors to monitor your heart rate, respiration rate, energy expenditure, calories burned, metabolic rate, speed, steps taken, ventilatory threshold, and recovery time.

Pedometers encourage joggers and walkers to set personal goals and can help assess your results. Accuracy and ease of use are essential when tracking your progress. Some of the <a href=""http://pedometers-review.toptenreviews.com/"">highest rated pedometers</a> include <a href=""http://www.fitbit.com/zip"">fitbit</a>, which tracks your steps, distance, and calories burned – and syncs those stats to your computer and select smartphones over time, and the <a href=""http://store.hermanstreet.com/electronics/yamax-power-walker-ex-510/?&amp;ICID=pin-Yamax%20Power%20Walker%202013-10-2pr"">Yamax-Power-Walker</a>, which also does a good job and features a 3D accelerometer sensor.

There’s always something new emerging from the world of technology to simplify self-monitoring, such as the <a href=""http://fitness-trackers-review.toptenreviews.com/larklife-review.html"">Larklife</a> fitness tracker that can also sense if you’ve had a good night’s sleep, with recommendations to boost your energy level when awake. At the very least, I recommend using a personal heart rate monitor that is able to keep track of your cardiovascular health, endurance levels and vitals. Even the most basic models give you instantaneous feedback about how your cardiovascular system is responding to your exercise session.

Here are a few more favorite tech gadgets and smart phone apps:
<ul>
 	<li>The <a href=""http://www.striiv.com/"">Strivv pedometer</a> not only counts your daily walking steps, it sets up challenges for your routine and lets you earn points for your achievements.  The pedometer features personalized challenges tailored to your activity levels, and turn 10,000 steps a day into playing a game, donating to charity and competing with friends.</li>
 	<li>For practical health, <a href=""http://www.fitbit.com/aria"">Fitbit’s Aria scale</a> doesn’t just measure your weight (which isn’t the <em>truest </em>measure of health) – it also measures body mass index and body fat, which are more revealing. The information is transmitted wirelessly to your computer and assists in making sure you are on track to reach your goals.</li>
 	<li>Tired? The <a href=""http://www.adidas.com/us/product/mens-running-energy-boost-shoes/CY950"">Adidas Energy Boost</a> running shoes claim micro cells embedded in the sole <em>return energy to each step you take</em>, taking the term “an extra pep in your step” quite literally.</li>
 	<li>Creativity keeps things interesting with the <a href=""https://www.zombiesrungame.com/"">Zombies, Run!</a> Smartphone app. As you run or walk, the narrator gives instructions to dodge zombies and other threats.  Novelist Naomi Alderman provides the storyline here – their website says “<em>you will go on an epic adventure that motivates you to run further and faster than ever before.</em>”</li>
 	<li>For a more serene app, try <a href=""http://www.pocket-sports.com/"">Pocket Yoga</a>, which lets you follow yoga routines from anywhere.  They also have an extensive library so you can learn anything from downward dog to warrior. The nice thing about the app is that it allows you to create your own yoga routine rather than forcing you to adhere to an instructors “<em>most liked</em>” poses!</li>
 	<li>Swimming is one of the best activities you can do for your body!  It’s quite easy on the joints and works nearly every muscle….<em>all the while taxing your heart and lungs</em>. There’s also a very meditative rhythm to swimming steady laps which is very peaceful.  But…no doubt – even swimming can get boring at times. Thankfully, there are the fully submersible <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/FINIS-SwiMP3-2G-X18-Firmware/dp/B00822529W/ref=sr_1_cc_1/?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369748846&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=neptune+headphones&amp;tag=hptech-21"">FiNIS SwiMP3 headphones</a> that transmit music through your cheekbones (<em>you can also listen to audiobook and podcasts if you’re swimming long distances!</em>).</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Another advance in health-and-fitness technology is the availability of health risk assessments and screenings through a straight-to-consumer service. Beyond checking with your regular care physician prior to beginning an exercise regime, you may want to also consider a basic blood-test screening that can offer detailed information about your diet, your hormonal profile, the state of your metabolism, as well as any possible early signs of heart disease or cancer. Values measured include levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol, calcium and iron; white and red blood cell count, hemoglobin and platelets in the blood. Updated health and fitness screenings ensure that your body is up for the challenges of extra physical activity. Take advantage of innovations like these and other “patient-centric” services that encourage a pro-active approach to keep your health and well-being on your radar. By staying aware of your body’s signals and signs, you will advocate your own good health, and can help determine the best path that should be followed.

3436,"Community Involvement","Whether you live in a condominium or a cottage in the country, you can still appreciate the importance of belonging to a functioning community. The ability to connect with others and share a common bond or goal, such as maintaining a safe and thriving community, becomes more valuable as we age. Knowing there is a support system in place when things go wrong is quite reassuring as you edge closer to realizing your limitations. There is no price tag that can be placed on the trust factor or your peace of mind.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9CLbg5pJbM?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
A community that embraces its seniors relies on a variety of activities and social events to strengthen bonds up and down the age ladder. If you want to reinforce your connection within your community, a good place to start is by calling or visiting the website of your local community or civic center. Sign up for any classes that peek your </strong>interest, or ask to speak to someone who can point you in the right direction if you want more specifics. Make it a point to participate in or patronize local events, such as charitable functions you want to support, bake sales and town fairs. Revel in the fun of attending a visiting carnival, outdoor concert or local cultural event to mingle within your community.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqIHqUTxVWg?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

A thriving community nurtures all age groups, including its’ eldest members. A study of the Hunzan population, nestled at the northernmost tip of Pakistan and connected with Russia and China, reveals why it is often considered the role model for community fellowship. Hunzan places great importance in remaining connected with their elder population.

The Hunzan community atmosphere is described as peaceful and good-natured, where the elders do their part to preserve traditions by remaining an active part of the daily routines. The community benefits extend to all residents, and every age group contributes to the success of Huzan’s agricultural terraces, which envelop mountainsides with sweeping staircases of lush vegetation and fruits, including apricots, pears, apples, peaches, plums, grapes, figs and melons. Happiness is at the core of their existence because they are truly alive.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SrsLRRielk?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The Hunzan valley exists among extremes in elevation, with the average peak ranging at twenty-thousand feet. With a population of under thirty-thousand people, the fertile valley has thrived for generations, even though it was almost completely inaccessible to outside influences due to hazardous and often inaccessible trails. John Robbins shares his assessment of the Hunzan people along with the insights of Dr. Alexander Leaf and U.S. Senator Charles Percy, a member of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, in “<a href=""http://johnrobbins.info/videos/healthy-at-100/"">Healthy at 100</a>,” Senator Percy was touched by the Hunzan people and the way they celebrate life – offering visitors a cheerful salutation of greetings and sweet offerings of local harvests, including flowers and fruit.

Even on crowded and fast-paced American soil, an old-fashioned sense of community can still be achieved, but it may require more of a pay-it-forward approach to get it kick started. Finding a niche to become engaged within your community may not be as simple where you live. It may entail reaching out to fill a void that satisfies an obvious need, such as helping at a local hospital or community after-school tutoring program.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsDCliVyUhI?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Start within your own neighborhood and your network of friends to organize an annual event to benefit a favored charity or cause, such as an auction or a fun run. Rough times have a tendency to bring out our charitable nature. Rally the neighborhood and the relatives when times are tough for someone that needs emergency or temporary support. We’ve all experienced downturns, and can sympathize with the underdog. Volunteer at a food bank, or soup kitchen that provides meals for the homeless to affect a no-frills, yet significant change within your community.

To fill the greatest need, start with the young members of your community – often languishing with boredom after school and usually receptive to organized sports or music-centered activities. With a little initiative and some basis people skills, need and want can fill a real void and make a big difference in your life, as well as many others within your community. There’s no shortage of good causes that are worthy of your time; just open your eyes and look around to discover the greatest needs and roll up your sleeves to make a difference.",,"2020-07-17 14:58:19",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/community-involvement/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/community-words.jpg,community-words,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/community-words.jpg,,Longevity,,"activities|age|charitable|community|events|fill|hunzan|hunzan people|importance|live|local|people|place|point|population|start|support|thriving|thriving community|visiting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3437,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",community-involvement,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:47:38",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3458,"Rx for Salt - Cut it Out","Salt is sometimes considered the silent killer, since many don’t acknowledge the threat that exists from a high-sodium diet. Sodium intake should never exceed 2,300 milligrams daily for a normal diet. High blood pressure is a determining factor in limiting salt intake to no more than 1,700 milligrams a day. <a href=""http://myoptimalhealthresource.blogspot.com/2013/10/excess-salt-consumption-implicated-in.html"">Excess-salt-consumption</a> is a contributor in raising the incidence of heart attack and stroke, according to an article published at <a href=""http://myoptimalhealthresource.blogspot.com/"">My Optimal Health Resource</a>. Lower daily salt intake to 1,000 mg or below to limit vascular disease. People who eat regularly at fast food restaurants and prepare meals using processed and refined foods can consume between 3,500 to 5,000 mg per day, placing them at considerable risk for chronic vascular disease.

Obvious foods to avoid are those high in sodium, such as soy sauce, since just one spoonful contains around 900 milligrams of sodium; consequently adding it and other high-sodium sauces to your food may cause water retention, leaving your abdomen feeling watery and uncomfortable. Other less-obvious, high-sodium foods include canned vegetables and most pre-packaged cereals and snack food items. Always verify the sodium content, especially in frozen, prepared meals, which are usually loaded with sodium - even the ones that claim to be healthy.<div class=""youtube_video_container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Namq4R2lj_8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Sodium, largely coming from the disproportionate amount of processed foods that many people eat, is killing millions around the globe. Scientists from the Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health now believe that eating too much salt contributed to 2.3 million deaths from heart attacks, strokes and other heart-related diseases throughout the world in 2010, representing 15 percent of all deaths due to these causes. With a growing body of evidence positioned against the use of salt, many prefer to use natural, flavor-enhancing alternatives, such as paprika and saffron, to reduce salt cravings.

Sea salt and table salt contain comparable amounts of sodium by weight. However, sea salt naturally promotes the absorption of potassium, is effective in reducing inflammation in the respiratory system, and helps to build a strong immune system against viruses, allergies and other autoimmune disorders. To maximize the benefits of sea salt, add it to food after it has been removed from heating sources. Sea salt can reduce the need for insulin by helping to maintain proper sugar levels in the body, making the wonder salt an essential part of your diet if you are diabetic, or at risk for the disease. Be sure to include a small amount of iodized table salt in your diet, as sea salt doesn’t contain the mineral iodine, which is necessary for the formation of the thyroid hormone in the thyroid gland.",,"2020-07-17 18:05:59",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/rx-for-salt-cut-it-out/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/n-SALT-628x314.jpg,n-SALT-628x314,"Salt from the sea",,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/n-SALT-628x314.jpg,,Longevity,,"daily|diet|disease|eat|food|foods|health|heart|high-sodium|intake|meals|milligrams|people|salt intake|sea|sea salt|sodium|table salt|vascular|vascular disease",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3459,default,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-17,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,517,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",rx-for-salt-cut-it-out,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:47:24",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3488,"Awesome Discounts for 50+ in 2019","Hi everyone!

A few years ago a friend sent me a list of discounts for the 50+ and this year, I decided it was time for an update. I’ve heard several times that YOU must ASK for your discount when you go to many of these places – they won’t just offer it (<em>not sure why!</em>).  Also, I’ve received a number of emails saying that some places are telling folks that the listed discount is a local (<em>or per store</em>) discount – not offered nationally at all locations – so if you’re turned down that may be the case.

<strong>Please note</strong><em> –</em> Although this list has been curated, companies are frequently updating their discounts. If you know of a useful discount that is not included on the list or find an outdated offering, please let me know!

<strong>This list may not only be useful for you, but for your friends and family, too – so feel free to share!</strong>

3845,"How To Reduce Depression In The Elderly And Stay Healthy","Depression in the elderly is a common complaint, but that does not mean it is normal nor should it just be accepted. Depression is a serious mood disorder that needs treatment and is not a symptom of old age. Depression affects every aspect of life physically, socially and cognitively, this is more readily seen in the elderly though. Depression in the elderly is very dangerous and often occurs with other chronic illnesses and disabilities which may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, suicide attempts, and death if it is not properly taken care of.

According to a study conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13.5% of the elderly on hospice and homecare, 11.5% of patients in hospitals and 1% to 5% of the general elderly population are suffering from depression.

The elderly often feel hesitant when asked about the changes in their feelings and behavior and this might raise the risk of misdiagnosis and lack of treatment. According to a recent observational study in 2015, it was revealed that the highest rate of suicide attempts in the United States were of people between the ages of 45-64 years.
<h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
You may notice one or more of the following symptoms in a depressed individual:
<ul>
 	<li>Insomnia</li>
 	<li>Lack of concentration</li>
 	<li>Feeling dull and inactive</li>
 	<li>Loss of interest in social activities</li>
 	<li>Feeling like a burden to others</li>
 	<li>Lack of concentrate &gt;</li>
 	<li>Low Self-esteem</li>
 	<li>Feelings of helplessness</li>
 	<li>Feelings of panic</li>
 	<li>Weight loss</li>
 	<li>Crying or emotional outbursts</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHY IS HE/SHE ACTING ABNORMALLY?</h3>
Diagnosing the symptoms of depression may be difficult in elderly patients as it might be part of  other physical illnesses. Amid treatments, it is important that your doctor works with a mental health provider to know the underlying cause of the depression in the elderly as well as other diseases which may contribute to it.
<h3>Treatments for Depression in the Elderly</h3>
Depression can be treated or minimized  by a number of different approaches. Below are a few of the methods of reducing depression in the elderly:
<h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
Talking and therapy can be a perfect treatment for depression in the elderly. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective way to eliminate behavioral patterns that contribute to the depresion symptoms of an elderly person.
<h3>Welcome To The Digital Age</h3>
The internet has made it easier to access anything from the past including music, movies, and historical documents. Show your elders how to listen to their favorite music from their youth, watch movies from the past, or how to read novels and stories. You can also show them how to  connect them with family and old friends on social media outlets. This can help to improve their mood and can also be very helpful in remembering good times and to forget the bad.
<h3>Memories Are Key</h3>
Once you know what the actual cause of the depression is in an individual do not try to highlight it as it may trigger the painful memories of what they have suffered. Instead try to engage them in simple activities that will help them forget.

Reminders about a person's life can trigger flashbacks and memories of better times. These positive memories can help to reduce their pain significantly. Studies have shown that even a single photo of one’s partner can greatly reduce emotional pain caused by depression in elderly patients.
<h3>A Shield Against Several Diseases</h3>
One of the most effective preventative measures against depression and  many other diseases is exercise. Our body contains many neuro-chemicals called endorphins that makes us feel good when released. Exercise is a natural way of releasing endorphins which is why many  joggers and runners experience a “Runner's High” during and after a race or marathon. Due to sitting idle or working in an isolated places for a long time, most elderly have lower levels of endorphins released during their days.

Exercise is responsible for promoting (BDNF) Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor, this factor is known to help cognitive improvements and can help with depression and anxiety. BDNF can foster the making new neurological connections that will help with enhancing memory and cognitive functionality . When someone engages in simple exercise it can lead to positive changes in brain function. These changes will in turn help combat depression and minimize the risk of depression in the eldar if they don’t current suffer from it.

&nbsp;
<h3>Early To Bed, Early To Rise</h3>
It has been observed that 80% of the depressive patients suffer insomnia. The most common reason for insomnia is irregular sleeping patterns of an individual. A lack of sleep is a major contributor to fatigue and bad mood. With this in mind try to convince the individual change their sleep routine and leave the rest to their natural automatic recovery system to get good night's sleep.",,"2020-09-30 12:05:34",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/how-to-reduce-depression-in-the-elderly-and-stay-healthy/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_785164294.jpg,shutterstock_785164294,,,"depression in the elderly",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_785164294.jpg,,Caregiving|Longevity,,"cause of the depression|changes|common|depression|depression in the elderly|elderly|elderly patients|endorphins|exercise|feelings|help|individual|lack|memories|patients|risk|sleep|suicide attempts|symptoms|treatment",,,,,,,76,,,"depression in the elderly",,"Depression in the elderly is a common complaint, but that does not mean it is normal nor should it just be accepted.

It is important that we pursue activities and hobbies to make our lives more memorable and joyous. Everyone deserves to be happy especially seniors, now that they are retired from the jobs that consumed most of their time and kept them busy all day. This article will show you the importance of having fun as a senior and some activities they can engage in.
<h3>Why Are Fun Activities Important For Seniors?</h3>
The role of entertainment and fun activities play in the life of seniors cannot be overlooked. Many fun activities for seniors cost little or nothing at all, and staying active is a perfect way of reducing a senior’s stress. Inactivity can leave seniors vulnerable to issues that can affect their health, happiness, and can even lead to depression. Fun activities for seniors such as playing games and socializing helps to maintain the memory and also can increase brain function and help to learn new things. Hobbies, entertainment and social gatherings are powerful tools that can keep seniors active and help maintain their physical strength. It is very important for the elderly to combat memory problems and enhance their mental activeness as well as to remain physically active to stay physically healthy. Below are few examples of fun activities for seniors and how they can improve seniors lives:
<h3>Fun Activities For Seniors</h3>

If this is the case, there is nothing wrong with experimenting and trying new activities or hobbies. What matters is that you keep active and reap the health benefits that come with staying active:
<h4>SPORTS, YOGA AND TAI CHI</h4>

3858,"Q&A w/Dr. A: Menopause and Exercise","<strong>Why is exercise important to emotional and physical health during perimenopause and menopause? </strong>Menopause can be a difficult time in a woman’s life both emotionally and physically. Emotionally, women must face the fact that they are no longer fertile. For some women this is a relief, but for others – particularly those who never had children, but wanted them – there may be a period of grieving. Even for women who have happily completed their families, menopause can be a sign of getting older, which women in our youth-obsessed culture may find difficult to accept. The hormone changes that occur during menopause can contribute largely to mood swings or feelings of depression and anxiety. Physically, menopause can be difficult not only because of the hot flashes and other short-term symptoms it causes, but because the loss of estrogen puts women at risk for health problems as diverse as brittle bones and heart disease. Fortunately, a program of regular exercise can improve both emotional and physical well being. Its many benefits include boosting your mood, strengthening your heart and even promoting bone density. Physical activity is one of the best antidotes to the problems that arise at menopause.

<strong>How can exercise influence menopausal symptoms? </strong>Some research suggests that being physically active can reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms such as hot flashes and, night sweats and sleep disturbances. Research does show that exercise has a positive effect on mood and can be useful for the depression that often coincides with “the change of life.” Exercising in the morning may improve your sleep at night and exercise can certainly be one of the best defenses against the weight gain many women experience as they get older.

<strong>How can your fat-to-muscle ratio and BMI affect how you feel during perimenopause and menopause? </strong>As we age, our fat-to-muscle ratio increases as we tend to lose muscle mass and add fat – particularly around the abdomen. This so-called visceral fat, which turns our bodies from a pair to an apple shape, has been linked to an increased risk of type II diabetes, heart disease and gallbladder problems and even breast cancer. Carrying around extra fat and less muscle may or may not affect body mass index (BMI), but it will likely affect your risk of certain health problems, and it can also affect the way you feel. You may be more sluggish and have difficulty doing some of the things you did when you were leaner and in good shape (of course, some of that is to be expected due to aging). As fat shifts from your thighs and hips to your abdomen and upper body, you may notice your waistband and tops are feeling tighter, even if the scales aren’t showing you have gained weight.

<strong>What special considerations should women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s make in regards to exercise? </strong>The main consideration is to play it safe. Exercise should be about <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/exercise-for-seniors/"">making you healthy</a>, not putting you at risk of an injury! This means you are going to need a little longer warm-up time than you did when you were younger. Allow about 10 minutes to warm up gradually – walking slowly, stretching, for example – before an exercise sessions. You should also avoid any exercises that may be unsafe – such as jarring exercises such as jogging, jumping or high-impact aerobics if you have bone or joint problems.

<strong>What are your top tips to women who are beginning an exercise routine during menopause? </strong>Again, my suggestion would be to play it safe – take time to warm up before your exercise routine, avoid exercises where injury is likely, start slowly and build gradually. You can’t get fit instantly – it is going to take time. I would also recommend that women make exercise enjoyable. Experiment with different types of exercise – dancing, walking, or working in the garden contribute to physical fitness – until you find something you really like. Try taking classes when you can meet people or arrange to walk with a friend. Mix up your exercise program to make it interesting – maybe dancing one day and yoga the next. If you like to walk try a change of scenery now and then. Even though it is convenient to walk the same streets in your neighborhood, take a walk through a friend’s neighborhood, at a historic site in your town or even at the mall on days when the weather is cold or bad.

<strong>What are the best forms of exercise for women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s? </strong>Staying physically active consistently is more important than engaging in any particular form of exercise; however, women in their 40s, 50s and 60s should make it a point to engage in three different forms of exercise:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Aerobic/ cardiovascular.</strong> This type of exercise, which includes walking, jogging, cycling, tennis, aerobics, working out on elliptical machine – strengthens the heart and lungs and burns calories to help with weight loss or maintenance.</li>
 	<li><strong>Resistance training.</strong> Exercises such as working out with dumbbells, resistance bands or exercise machines are helpful for strengthening muscles and bones and increasing metabolism to help with weight management.</li>
 	<li><strong>Flexibility/stretching/range of motion. </strong>Stretching exercises, yoga and pilates can help keep aging bodies more flexible can be particular helpful for improving or maintaining joint function if joints are affected by arthritis.</li>
</ul>
Beyond this, the particular exercises women do should be based on their likes and any health problems they might have. For example, women who have arthritis in their knees should avoid running or jogging, which would put extra stress on their knees. Women with <a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/155646.php"">osteoporosis</a> (brittle bones) should avoid activities such as bicycling or sports that could put them at risk of impact that could break a bone. The best exercise is one you enjoy and will do regularly.

<strong>Are there any forms of exercise that menopausal women should avoid? </strong>Women should only avoid exercises that present a risk to their health or safety. You should never try anything too strenuous or difficult for your fitness level or abilities. It takes time to gain strength, so go slowly. If you have joint or bone problems, avoid exercises that are jarring or that might involve impact that could cause an injury.

<strong>How can women minimize the loss of muscle as they age?</strong> Heed the old saying “use it or lose it.” If you don’t use your muscles you will lose muscle mass. For that reason, strengthening exercises are particularly important for women in their 40s and beyond. This includes working out with dumbbells, weight machines or resistance bands. For women who are just getting started with <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/fitness-over-fifty/"">strengthening exercise</a> or who have health concerns, I would recommend working with a physical therapist or personal trainer who can recommend an appropriate strengthening program.

<strong>The Buying Power of Baby Boomers</strong>

Need more convincing? Think about the 50+ population as a whole. They not only wield enormous purchasing power since they routinely make the major decisions in their households, these aging parents account for 80% of the consumer goods market. In addition, baby boomers are accumulating much more wealth than their younger counterparts, now accounting for more than $2.9 trillion in consumer spending. Don’t know why that’s significant? Despite the 2008 recession, baby boomer spending was up an astonishing 45% as compared to the previous ten years, that’s why! They account for nearly 50 percent of all consumer packaged goods sales, 77 percent of prescription drug sales, 80 percent of leisure travel spending and 41 percent of all new car purchases.

<strong>Baby Boomers and the Family</strong>

Of course, that doesn’t mean that older adults spend their money haphazardly. Baby boomers frequently self-report that they are most concerned about investing money in their family’s future, baby boomers are starting to spend less on frills and more on their families.  More specifically, they’re worried about helping their adult children pay off mortgages and making sure their parents maintain an independent lifestyle. In fact, research shows that family is considered to be one of the highest priorities among baby boomers, so services that cater to those relationships will resonate with them. Financial institutions are taking advantage of this trend by providing retirement and pension plans that older adults can pay into for their loved ones and a myriad of companies are focusing on the vast numbers of boomers who are caregiving for mature adult family members by creating innovative personal communication systems to help boomers and their parents stay connected. Targeted services like these (<em>that pull on the heart strings!)</em> are definitely key when it comes to appealing to baby boomers and securing them as customers.

<strong>It’s Time to Focus on Baby Boomers!</strong>

As you can see, the 50+ population is still a swiftly developing consumer market, and it’s hitting an all time high in terms of global aging. While catering to baby boomers may not necessarily fit into every business’s product and service portfolio, these examples show that they’re definitely a demographic that deserves closer attention from you and your organization.

3868,"Women: Love in the Third Act","The kids are out of the house or at least mostly independent, your job and your life may be moving at a slower pace. Perhaps you and/or your spouse have even retired. For the first time since the early days of marriage the two of you may actually have time together, doing the things the two of you like to do. This is about the time of life I often hear women say, “I’m getting to know my husband again and I have discovered I DON’T like him.”

If you are in a second or subsequent marriage to a husband who entered your life after one or all of your children, this may be the first time in your relationship you have extended alone time.

For many couples the empty nest is a love nest. Couples that get past the usual conflicts that can arise long after exchanging vows tend to focus more on their common ground, and don’t sweat the differences. After decades of surviving through highs and lows, such as sickness, financial concerns, and family conflicts, a marriage built on mutual respect has a solid foundation to succeed a lifetime.

The benefits of staying together for a lifetime are immeasurable. Besides offering emotional support through life’s tragedies, including sickness and the death of loved ones, the lingering effects are less painful when shouldered with a spouse. Double-income families create double-income retirement and pension funds, which can translate into living upgrades and more frequent travels. (But don’t count on your husband’s pension to see you through retirement. We’ll talk more about financial planning in Chapter TK.)

By developing a watchdog approach for each other, longevity becomes a mutual goal. Develop new habits with a buddy-system approach that keeps you both on track for fitness and diet goals. Watch for early signs of disease that your spouse may not easily notice, such as sleep apnea or other sleep-related disorders, and become pro-active toward each other’s good health.

Having someone to share the aging process with can make it a little easier – and more interesting -- for both of you. Foster communication by sharing quality time together. For instance, breakfast is the perfect setting to mark the day’s beginning, plan trips, discuss current events and offer upbeat, emotional support for personal issues, such as fading eyesight and receding hairlines.

<strong>Adjusting to Your Spouse’s Retirement </strong>

“Familiarity breeds contempt.”

Although you probably learned differently in high school Brit Lit, I am pretty sure the first person to say this was a woman whose husband had retired.

While many couples benefit from the increased alone-together-time that comes with one or both spouses’ retirement, for many women the retirement of a spouse requires a period of adjustment. You once looked forward to your time with your husband. Now there’s nothing to look forward to – he’s <em>always</em> there. Sure, he’s a great guy, but it’s possible to get too much of a good thing – like turkey. You look forward to your Thanksgiving dinner and it tastes great, but then come the turkey sandwiches, turkey soup, turkey salad, turkey sandwiches again, turkey soup again, a little freezer-burned turkey two months later. You get the picture.

This is also a time when conflicts tend to arise or escalate. You’re expecting some help with household chores, leisurely lunches at local eateries, or days spent sight-seeing or antiquing. He’s expecting more time by the TV, sleeping in and having a nice lunch prepared and delivered to his TV tray by you! Alternatively, he may want to go go go and you are happy to stay home and relax for a change.

You’ve got to plan and stand your ground to keep what could and should be a happy time for both of you from ending in disaster. Give your spouse and yourself the gift of space and time to adjust to a change as major as retirement. Greet him the first morning of retirement with a kiss – not with a to-do list. You’ve probably been waiting for some time to get some projects and household repairs completed, so waiting another month or two won’t hurt. His first days off work should not be filled with work.

If your husband has retired and you haven’t, or vice versa, use this transition time to test the waters and prepare for the journey ahead.

To avoid the onset of conflict that comes with spending endless days and nights under the same roof, make a plan to share the brunt of domestic chores. Evaluate the household duties, such as yard work, cooking and cleaning to re-distribute lopsided chores that were performed with habitual ease throughout active career schedules, and which may require a revamp to accommodate less-demanding lifestyles and less-nimble bodies.

Since retirement is supposed to be fun, take the calendar out once a month to plan activities that please each of you as well as activities you enjoy together. Also strive to include several family-centered events in the itinerary. Separate vacations once in a while may help ease the confinement of too many hours spent under the same roof together while giving the relationship breathing room to appreciate each other’s absence.

<strong>Divorce </strong>

Marriage, as you know, is all about give and take. But after years and years of giving, some women decide they just can’t take it anymore. That’s likely why two-thirds of divorces are initiated by women.

“I had been with a man I never really loved for 30 years,” one slender attractive 54-year-old told me after a presentation last week. “I finally said ‘enough already.’”

Many women have told me they knew the marriage was ending once the children had moved out. “As long as the kids were home Jeff and I always had something to talk about, something to focus on besides how unhappy we had become as a couple,” said Brenda, a longtime friend of mine who divorced her husband after 28 years of marriage.

Others have told me about finally getting the strength to leave abusive marriages or of having a husband up and leave them. “I woke up one morning and Andy announced he was leaving. Just like that,” says Martha, a 60-year-old accountant who continued to fight back tears three years after her ex-husband’s announcement. Her husband, she said, had met a woman half his age on line and decided rather quickly he <em>had</em> to be with her. Martha was blindsided and crushed by his announcement.

While celebrating a silver or golden wedding anniversary once meant you’d likely be together for life, increasingly couples are divorcing after these important milestones. This goes to show if you want to preserve your marriage, you can never stop working on it, and if you want out, it’s not too late.

<strong>Finding Love in Unexpected Places</strong>

If you’re not still married to your first true love – or married at all for that matter – you are far from alone. Half of marriages in America end in divorce, and even for couples who remain together for life, life often ends sooner for the husband, leaving the wife alone.

The Population Bureau reports in its <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2011/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx"">2011 bulletin</a> that “Although older women today are more likely to be married than they were 50 years ago, they are still much less likely to be married than their male counterparts. Among the population ages 65 and older, about three quarters of men, but less than half (44 percent) of women were married in 2010.” This trend will likely continue.

With fewer men than women to start with and many men in our age group choosing to be with younger women – or other men -- it may seem that our chances of finding love at this stage of life are nil. But many women do find love at 50, 60, 70 and beyond. Some women tell me they actually have more options than they did when they were younger, because they are looking for different qualities or feel less bound to what they consider to be conventional relationships. As you grow in age and maturity you are more likely to seek out or become involved with someone who interests and excites you than someone who would be a good breadwinner, a good father or an acceptable son-in-law to your parents. Factors like age, race, religion and even gender may become less important than when you were in your 20s or 30s.

For example, Gina, a divorced friend of mine who was in her mid 40s, dated and married a younger man –28 – she met on her morning commute on the subway. Had she dated him the first time around he would have been like eight (eew!). But as she approached 50, the combination worked great for them. When I heard from her last, they had built a dream home in the mountains. She had retired. He had begun a consulting firm that he ran from their home. They had just celebrated their 15<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary and gave every indication that there would be many more to come.

Another friend, Jamie, who is Jewish, told me she had recently reconnected with her high school sweetheart, Mike, a devout Southern Baptist. As a younger woman she said it was important to her that the man she married was Jewish or willing to convert. His unwillingness to do so as well as interference from both of their families led to their breakup. But two divorces and a class reunion later they rekindled their love and their religious differences no longer mattered. While she spends her Sunday mornings teaching a third-grade Sunday school class at her temple Mike is singing Christian hymns from the choir loft of a church two miles down the road. The rest of the weekend – and much of the week – the two are inseparable.

Abby, a petite blond woman, who met her husband in college and raised three girls with him, fell in love with an African-American man she met in a grief support group after her husband was killed in an accident. The man’s wife had recently lost a long battle with breast cancer. Initially they shared grief experience, but in doing so grew to discover they shared much more. Three years later they married.

Other women have discovered it was not a man they want at all. Another friend, Fran, a-stay-at-home mom, whose youngest was a senior in high school, was devastated when her husband, a middle school principal, left her for one of the young teachers at his school. In order to make ends meet and relieve loneliness after her daughter left for college, she sold the house and moved in with a friend who had plenty of space to share in her home because her husband had also left her. While the two spent many evenings man bashing at first, they soon discovered that they hated men less than they loved each other. Today they introduce themselves as a couple, and they seem very happy. It’s not unusual for women who have married and raised children to discover later in life that they are interested in women. For example, after three failed marriages that produced five children, actress Meredith Baxter Birney announced in 2009 that she was a lesbian. “I am a lesbian and it was a later-in-life recognition,” she told Matt Lauer on TODAY. “Some people would say, well, you’re living a lie and, you know, the truth is — not at all. This has only been for the past seven years.”

I’m not suggesting that anyone should —or even could at will – change their sexual orientation. Nor do I think you should compromise religious beliefs or other values that are important to you. But for women who are open to relationships with people that they might not have considered or accepted when they were younger, there are many opportunities to find love.

<strong>Where Not to Look</strong>

While we are talking about unconventional romantic partners, I would like to stress one type of partner you should not choose: a married man. I know that should be pretty obvious, but I am surprised by the number of women my age who tell me they have become involved with a married man – often an old boyfriend they have become reacquainted with at a class reunion or through Facebook. The story is often the same: He is no longer in love with his wife. The spark has gone out of their relationship. They have nothing in common. He only stayed with her because of the kids, and now they are grown. He is planning to leave her. You were the one he should have married the first time around. Sound familiar? Don’t fall for it! You’re only setting yourself up for heartache and hurting another woman and her family. If he wants to leave his wife, let him do it (I’m guessing he won’t), but at the very least don’t become involved with him until he does.

<strong>Dating after 50 </strong>

If your attire for your last date included culottes or parachute pants, you may find things have changed since your last awkward goodnight kiss at the door. For starters, thanks to cell phones, there’s texting, and sexting and no need to wait by the phone for him to call. (Not that that was ever a good idea, but face it, we’ve all done it – waiting by the phone, that is.) There are also diseases (namely HIV) that were non-existent back when we watched those VD films in junior high and our most pressing question was whether we could get herpes or syphilis from a public toilet seat.

With the Internet and almost unlimited dating sites -- some targeted to the 50-plus crowd -- we have access to a range of dating partners (which unfortunately carries some dangers) we could not have imagined when we were younger. Yet TODAY’s “This is 50” survey found that about 80 percent of 50-somethings find partners the old fashioned way – through friends and family.

Regardless of how you meet a date, most of the same dating rules apply. Here’s a quick refresher of my six rules for dating, a few of which were adapted from a popular 2013 Huffington Post blog.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Let your date do the talking.</strong> It’s in our DNA – we women love to talk. If we live alone or are feeling lonely, we are pretty much willing to talk to anyone who will listen. But just this once try being the listener. By asking questions and listening more than talking, you show that you are interested in him (guys really like that). It also helps you steer the conversation. If he can’t stop talking about hunting or fishing, ask him about favorite movies he’s seen. If he can’t stop talking about how much beer he can put away, or how many decibels his burps or farts are, ask him politely to take you home. Better yet, excuse yourself and take Uber!</li>
 	<li><strong>Flirt.</strong> Keep it tasteful, of course, but let him know you are interested. Touch his arm, twirl your hair, laugh at his jokes and compliment him. Guys love it and it’s fun.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t call him.</strong> Sorry, but this advice hasn’t changed since the invention of the landline. Guys still like to be the aggressor and if you take the initiative to call him after a date or two – or worse yet question why <em>he</em> hasn’t called <em>you</em> -- you risk looking needy and pathetic. Who wants needy and pathetic?</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t rush into a relationship.</strong> If you’re recently widowed or divorced, don’t jump into a relationship too quickly. While most counselors recommend waiting at least a year to remarry after a divorce or death of a spouse, you may feel an urgency to connect too soon if you think you have found “the one.” Try to remind yourself that while loneliness is not fun, spending the rest of your life with the wrong person can be hell.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wait for sex. </strong>No, you’re probably not saving your virginity for your one true love – or then maybe you still are. How would I know? – but sex should still be special if you care about the guy and imagine a future with him. (Remember the old saying about getting the milk for free?) If he wants a one-night stand let him hire a prostitute. Hold yourself to a higher standard than that. He’ll respect you for it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Use protection.</strong> OK, if you’re ready for an intimate relationship or you have ignored number 5 – and particularly if you have ignored number 5 -- and are going home with a guy you barely know, bring along a condom. According to the CDC, in 2013, 27 percent of the new AIDS diagnoses in the U.S. were in people 50 and older. Percentages of other STDs among older daters have increased too. (More about that to come.) Don’t up the percentages. Be prepared!</li>
</ol>
<strong>Use caution when meeting online dates</strong>

In the 2010 documentary film Catfish, the young star Nev Schulman discovered that the “attractive young dancer” with whom he had an online relationship was actually a middle-age mother of four. The great “guy” you meet online could also be a middle-age mother of four -- seriously, you never know who you are talking to until you meet them. More serious than a date who lies about his age, occupation or even gender is one who is a threat to your safety. If you’re going to be speaking with prospective dates by phone, purchase a burn phone. It can’t be tracked to your address and if a guy gets creepy and won’t stop calling you, you can cancel your number or simply throw the phone away.

<strong>Sex – Benefits and Beware</strong>

Whether it is with your lifelong love or you’re ready to take the step with a new one, physical has many benefits and can come in many different forms, including spooning beneath the blanket and giving each other massages and back rubs. Scientists have long known that the oxytocin our bodies produce during intimacy promotes bonding. It turns out that it also helps us sleep better, withstand stress better and generally feel better about ourselves. The act of sex itself has the added benefits of cardiovascular exercise, burning calories, improving bladder control, and easing pain.

If it’s been a while don’t expect sex to be exactly like it was when you were younger. Sure, you’ll hear sex is great when you’re not concerned about pregnancy (see warning below) or you’re sharing it with an experienced partner or lifelong love or whatever, but don’t be fooled. Without proper lubrication – which you’re not likely to produce yourself at this point – it can feel like your man’s member is covered in sand paper. Ouch! So a word of warning: Stock up on the KY Jelly and be prepared to take it slow.

If you are considering intimacy with someone new, practice safe sex, preferably waiting until the two of you are monogamous. If you are not certain you have gone through menopause, pregnancy is extremely rare, but not an impossibility – even at 50. The far greater risk among 50-plus women, however, is sexually transmitted diseases, and the CDC reports that their incidence is increasing -- particularly in the over-65 group.

Between 2010 and 2014 among those 65 and older, chlamydia infections increased by about 52 percent, syphilis infections rose by about 65 percent, and gonorrhea cases increased by more than 90 percent.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 2.2 million Medicare beneficiaries received STD screenings and counseling in 2011 and 2012. That is roughly the same number who had colonoscopies.

What gives? Experts offer a number of explanations, including the use of drugs like Viagra and Cialis that make sex possible for more older couples and the fact that baby boomers, who came of age in the era of the pill, don’t generally use condoms. According to the 2010 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, the largest nationally representative and comprehensive study on sexual behavior ever conducted in the United States, older adults have the lowest rate of condom use of all age groups.

This can be a particular problem for women because the vaginal lining thins after menopause, making us even more vulnerable to infections than when we were young.

The take-home message: If you’ll be taking a man home with you or going home with him, have a condom handy (and make sure your lubricant is safe for use with condoms). Don’t expect him to. The responsibility for your safety is you.

<strong>Living Alone Without Being Lonely</strong>

Whether it’s from choice and planned or comes unwelcomed and unexpectedly due to death or divorce, many of us will find ourselves alone at some point. Depending on the circumstances and your personality, living alone can be a welcome change from the bustle of a busy home or endless days and nights with an abusive – or just boring – husband, or it can be a great source of unhappiness and stress.

Research has shown that people who live alone are more likely to suffer from depression than those who live with a significant others. In a study of some 3,500 men and women published in the journal <em>BMC Public Health</em>, those who lived alone were 81 percent more likely to have filled at least one prescription for an antidepressant over the course of the study.

The study’s participants ranged in age from 30 to 65. Research suggests the risk of depression is even higher for older people who live alone and may feel isolated and fearful. For these adults, solo living can lead to chronic stress, and research is beginning to show that chronic stress can lead to changes in your genes, says Steve Cole, professor of medicine and behavioral sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Cole’s research, labeled, “<a href=""http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2013/social-genomics.aspx"">Social Genomics</a><u>,”</u> examines how psychological experiences influence immune systems and human health. He is mapping the biological pathways through which social conditions change the expression of traits or tendencies encoded in genetic material.

Researchers in this growing field of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Genomics"">social genomics</a> are finding that social activities today may influence our bodies for the next few months or for the rest of our lives. They are also finding that even after exposure to adverse social conditions that cause health to decline, people placed in a more favorable environment may see their health rebound. That means that even if you are in your 50s or beyond there is still room to change your world for the better to have that filter down through your body into the genome.

If you are planning to be alone or unexpectedly find yourself that way, my first piece of advice is to do what it takes for you to feel safe. Take a personal defense class. Get a security system -- or a big dog – or move to a building with good security or to a home in the suburbs.

My second piece of advice is to avoid isolation. Meet friends or co-workers for lunch or dinner, plan frequent get-togethers with your family if they are close by, and if not, visit them (or invite them to visit you) when possible. Get involved in clubs or activities, attend concerts or art shows, scour flea markets or antique malls and take time to chat with those you meet. Explore the benefits of online friendships. “Friend” old acquaintances on Facebook, or look for new ones with common interests. Consider starting your own blog to document your green thumb or culinary creations and send the link to your family, friends and online buddies.

My third piece of advice is to surround yourself with the vitality of other living things. Begin each day surrounded by a variety of plants. Consider the benefits of cultivating an assortment of planters filled with fragrant and practical varieties of herbs, or plant a small vegetable garden, if space allows.

If you don’t already have a pet, consider getting one. Who can succumb to loneliness and depression when an adoring pooch is begging for a belly rub and a walk? Who can feel stressed when stroking a cat’s soft fur?

Research shows that pet ownership can do more than relieve loneliness – it can increase longevity. Research by the American Heart Association has found that owning a dog lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease and speeds recovery from heart attacks. Other research suggests that petting a dog can lower blood pressure and that taking a long gaze into your dog’s eyes can increase the release of oxytocin, a hormone that relieves stress and promotes a sense of well-being.

Finally, owning a dog can lead to contact and interactions with people. If you don’t believe me, try it out with a friend’s dog first. Take a walk through your neighborhood or a busy park and see how many people stop to pet your dog, ask about your dog or tell you about their dog. A dog or even an exotic pet – a friend of mine met a lot of people while walking her pet ferret! – is an instant conversation starter, and you never know where the conversation may lead!

3872,"Watch Your Sugar Intake","If you haven’t heard the grim truth about sugar, then listen up. All types of processed and refined sugars, including high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, and glucose, and processed foods that list one or more of these as the main ingredients are not your friend. The massive amounts of refined sugars contained in the typical Western diet are designed to stimulate appetites and increase consumption. All commercially processed foods made with added sugar contain glucose and fructose. Approximately one third of all calories in the average American diet come from refined sugar and corn syrup consumption

By the age of sixty-five, many Americans experience obesity, kidney stones, tooth decay, diabetes, heart disease and other related debilitating ailments. Blood-sugar spikes create insulin surges as processed sugar is quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. That is just one of the many <a href=""http://consumerscompare.org/infographic-14-facts-about-sugar/"">facts about sugar</a> that you need to consider when reaching for the sugar bowl. Processed sugar also plays a role in the possible onset of insomnia, depression, hypertension, colon and pancreatic cancer, skin breakouts and metabolic syndrome. Refined sugar depletes the body of B vitamins and other nutrients, which can lead to indigestion and allergies.

According to the American Dietetic and Diabetic Associations, increased sugar consumption is the leading cause of degenerative disease. The average American consumes 53 gallons of soft drink per every year. The average can of soda has about 40 grams, or 10 teaspoons of sugar. One large 64-ounce soda contains approximately 53 teaspoons of sugar! Unfortunately, carbonated soft drinks are the largest source of refined sugar in the American diet.

Opt to explore the vast variety of herbal and natural teas that can easily replace a craving for soda with a flavor to suit every taste and mood, including fruit-infused varieties and others that ease stress. The therapeutic benefits of a calming cup of tea can never be underestimated. Consider adding a touch of lemon and natural honey or agave nectar instead of unhealthy sugar to keep joints lubricated and soothe a dry or scratchy throat. Coffee, in moderation, is actually considered beneficial to trigger the brain and aid in memory tasks. Stick with decaffeinated coffee in the afternoon to minimize the risk of insomnia or restlessness at bedtime.

It’s been proven that blood sugar directly affects <a href=""http://www.drperlmutter.com/blood-sugar-relates-brain-size-function/"">brain size and function</a>. The Journal of Neurology reported a relationship was indicated between the degree of atrophy and blood- sugar measurements. Even subtle elevations of blood sugar have been tied to brain shrinkage through performed cognitive tests that pointed to a direct relationship between failing memory and blood sugar elevation.

The secret to managing most <a href=""http://www.stopagingnow.com/articles/29656/The-Secret-to-Preventing-Most-Age-Related-Diseases"">age-related diseases</a> is to control your sugar intake, according to an article written by John Phillip for Stop Aging Now. Phillips shares insights on how sugar affects our body, “Excess blood sugar triggers a cascade of potentially deadly processes that contribute to diabetes, hardening of the coronary arteries and neuropathic complications. High glucose levels from dietary sugar and excess carbohydrate consumption provokes the release of chemical cytokines that promote arterial wall inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Eventually the pancreas is no longer able to secrete enough insulin, and the insulin that is produced is no longer able to efficiently escort sugar to the cells and muscles.” Aging systems are challenged with the rigors of keeping an over-taxed system in check and eventually succumb to sugar’s debilitating effects.

Opt for natural sweeteners found in locally produced honey and ripe fruits, such as dates and figs, to offset the negative triggers of processed sugar. Consider adding a juicer to your kitchen lineup to benefit from nature’s sweeteners and nutrients, and a full array of vitamins. Designate breakfast as a sugar-free, fresh fruit smoothie meal once or twice a week to energize the day with a base of one-third cup of low-fat, plain yogurt that depends on fruit and fiber to deliver nutrition and flavor. By adjusting to the natural sweetness of fruit, the body does not have to work as hard, which decreases the chances of diseases and chronic illness.

Artificial sweeteners are not recommended for long-term use, as they contain chemicals and a glycemic index that is slightly higher than processed sugar. It’s been suggested that artificial sweeteners can reduce brain function over time. Two hundred times sweeter than sugar, some people get headaches from the aspartame-based sweetener called Equal and certain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, have been linked to its long-term use. Saccharin, the sweetening agent in Sweet ‘N Low, has been around since 1879, and is 300 times sweeter than sugar, even when used in hot beverages, and can have a metallic aftertaste. With long-term, continued use, you may get so used to saccharin’s intense sweetness that you start craving sugary treats. While saccharin has been linked to bladder cancer in rats, experts have found no conclusive evidence of its correlation with cancer in humans.

Cinnamon or vinegar taken before eating can help lower post meal blood sugar spikes and can complement a proper diet. The most dependable way to naturally cut blood sugar levels is to dramatically lower calories from carbohydrate sources at each meal. Totally eliminate all processed and refined carb foods including bread, pasta, corn and rice to decrease blood sugar levels. Depending on carbohydrate sensitivity, some individuals may also need to limit fruits and starchy vegetables, like potatoes and corn. The Journal of the American College of Nutrition believes that a diet rich in monounsaturated fats such as the Mediterranean diet improves post-meal blood glucose levels and moderates healthy insulin response.

3876,"To Live Alone or With Family Members","As you age, your living arrangements will occasionally require an objective appraisal of your aging physiology. Evaluate your basic day-to-day needs to ask questions about your ability to live alone.
<ul>
 	<li>Do you require help on a daily basis? Do you get it?</li>
 	<li>Can you complete everyday tasks, such a preparing a meal, without feeling exhausted or confused?</li>
 	<li>Does getting behind the wheel to run regular chores, such as grocery shopping, cause stress or anxiety?</li>
 	<li>Has the quality of your life suffered because of physical, mental or emotional challenges?</li>
</ul>
These are some of the toughest questions you will ever have to answer, but an honest appraisal of your limitations is necessary to avoid the onset of further complications and to maintain the quality of your life.

Mobility concerns remain an insurmountable issue attributing to the logistics of longevity. Often, the decision to stop living alone is expedited by other events, such as relinquishing your driving privileges. According to<em> “</em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Neuropsychology-Dementia-Clinical-Handbooks/dp/1461431050"">The Handbook on Neuropsychology of Aging and Dementia</a>,” drivers aged 65 and above are significantly more likely to be involved in crashes at intersections, stop signs, while turning against oncoming traffic and while changing lanes. The study explains that these types of moving crashes are viewed as “high risk” since they can result in significant injuries. Inability to run errands with your own vehicle can be a seen as a minor inconvenience that is easily solved with the help of good friends and family.

Transportation needs can also be supplemented with community transportation services that cater to seniors, with drop off and pick up service to local grocery stores and to handle personal errands and doctor’s appointments. Household chores may also become burdensome on a regular basis, particularly if you have a traditional home that also requires lawn care and regular maintenance. You may opt to hire professional services, such as a maid and lawn maintenance company, however, remember to factor the extra expenses into your budget for the long haul, or recruit family members to help out.

If you’re not quite ready to vacate the premises, explore the idea of a roommate arrangement as a stepping stone that can eventually lead to living with your children or other family members. By inviting someone you trust, such as a close sibling or mature relative, into your home, you can share the burden of performing regular chores, including cooking and cleaning. This strategy may enable you to delay moving into a relative’s home while giving you some extra companionship. Financial perks could also ease monthly bills by sharing utility and/or housing expenses with a live-in relative or close friend. Opt to select a roommate that is in reasonably good health, has a regular income and access to a reliable vehicle available for trips to the grocery or other household errands.

A family experiencing an economic downturn quickly learns to appreciate the potential contributions of their retired parents, including the perks of receiving part of a regular retirement pension income to help meet living expenses while trying to secure regular employment. In those cases, seek out the potential <em>win-win</em>, in which the caregiver realizes extra financial security in exchange for providing quality senior care of a loved one. Discuss this type of living arrangement with other siblings and family members first to get their feedback prior to committing to a permanent arrangement.

It’s often hard to admit when you need help, especially if you cherish your independence. Avoid denial by recognizing that your body and mind has more limitations – and moves slower than when you were younger, and be willing to ask for and receive help when it is needed. If living alone has restricted your lifestyle or adversely affected your health or well-being, consider a move with relatives to be a potential lifeline to your longevity.

When you consider the options, which may include nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and roommate arrangements, moving in with family may be the most logical solution. Who better to trust with your well-being than a beloved and trusted member of your family? Discuss your options with everyone involved to avoid confusion or misunderstanding and include financial, transportation and health concerns in the conversation, along with any other issue requiring clarification. Be prepared to contribute to monthly living expenses, and specify your need for any personal requirements, such as bathroom grab bars and a smoke-free environment.

Moving in with family members is a decision that should be made with consideration of all persons that are affected by the change, including children within the household. Discuss the changes that will directly affect living conditions, such as bedroom re-assignments, bathroom schedules and mealtime planning considerations (seniors often have different dietary needs and eating schedules than busy families).

Focus on the positive aspects of blended generations within the family structure. Strive for maintaining a solid foundation that can instill old-fashioned ethics and values. Seniors have time to reflect on life’s trials and adventures with hindsight perspective and have invaluable experience worth sharing with younger generations. A residency change can be life-affirming for you and your family, while increasing your longevity - if pursued with the right attitude.",,"2020-06-30 16:56:39",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/to-live-alone-or-with-family-members/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/o-OLDER-WOMAN-ALONE-facebook.jpg,o-OLDER-WOMAN-ALONE-facebook,"Mature woman sitting on sofa, looking away in thought",,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/o-OLDER-WOMAN-ALONE-facebook.jpg,,Caregiving,,"alone|avoid|discuss|errands|expenses|extra|family|family members|help|home|living|living alone|living expenses|members|moving|moving in with family|quality of your life|regular chores|seniors|transportation",,,,,,,,,,,"Living Alone or With Family by Dr. Alexis Abramson","As you age, your living arrangements will occasionally require an objective appraisal of your aging physiology.

3880,"Making the Intergenerational Blended Family Work","Blended families extend in all directions, with branches that often include several step-children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, nieces and nephews – all perfect sidekicks for the centenarian. Nurturing families are one of the keys to successful longevity and often the result of instilled traditions and cultural influences passed down through generations.

We can all be inspired by multi-generational cultures that abound in distant locations, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilcabamba,_Ecuador"">Vilcabamba</a>, a small, isolated town located at an altitude of approximately 4,500 feet in Ecuador’s Andes mountain region, where a nurturing attitude is embraced by all ages. Translated, Vilcabamba means “<em>Sacred Valley</em>,” and for good reason. The valley sustains a year-round temperate climate of 68 degrees that supports a robust variety of vegetables, fruit and grains which helps the villagers flourish within their pristine environment that is void of most modern conveniences. Although residents of the humble village lack the basics, such as inside plumbing, they have access to pure mineral drinking water, which is a priceless commodity by any standard. The lack of material abundance, as gauged by Western standards, is seldom eulogized or lamented among villagers. Instead, they embrace a genuine sense of love, joy and unselfishness that sustains all ages through life’s transitions.

Notable scientists, physicians and respected journalists, including Grace Halsell and Dr. Alexander Leaf, stayed in the region for an extended time to live among the locals and observe the village customs and culture. Besides Halsell and Leaf, many others have taken note of the general attitude in Vilcabama’s residents, as a sense of communal harmony is interwoven through every age group and every level of their lives. The oldest villagers are regarding as the most respected generation, worthy of perpetual admiration and praise, and are often referred to as, “<em>The Ancient Ones</em>.” The small community celebrates and embraces their aging citizens, rather than putting them out to pasture. The youngsters are eager to enjoy the company of their elders, knowing there is wisdom to be gained from each encounter.

The longevity guide entitled, “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345490118?tag=wwwhealthyat1-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0345490118&amp;adid=1R3EH1ZKK9YY2ZPSJKQP&amp;"">Healthy at 100</a>,” shares the insights of Halsell and Leaf regarding the amazing cross-generational connections and overall sense of vitality that exists among the locals. The guide suggests Western families emulate the successful traits of these cultures in order to open our hearts and minds to the aging population and discard the notion that getting older is a death sentence that leads to isolation and eventually, the dreaded nursing home, or even worse - a lonely death. Tim Robbins, a best-selling author on the subject, shares this insights:

<em>“If we want to create a healthy relationship to aging, then cultures like Abkhasia and Vilcabamba have much to offer us in how we understand our place in the life cycle. In these cultures, elders are looked up to and appreciated for their wisdom. They feel socially useful and needed.</em>”

Although it requires a village to successfully adapt this kind of attitude toward the elderly, positive attitudes can be instilled and passed through all generations to ensure that respect begins in the home. Emulate the endearing Vilcabamban attitude toward aging and celebrate the accomplishments of older loved ones with symbols of honor and appreciation instead of succumbing to morbid clichés, like ‘<em>over the hill’</em> and ‘<em>old fart’</em> that imply the end of a person’s useful life.

Americans, in general, have embraced mobility to keep pace with a society that requires regular travel between time zones, and sometimes even permanent re-location from original family roots. Re-establish broken connections with endearing family members whom have moved away with a Vilcabamban approach that maintains strong family ties through both good and bad times. Keep a record of birthdays, graduations and other important dates in the lives of loved ones to acknowledge their milestones and encourage them to celebrate.

A mutual hobby, game, sport, television show or activity can be the common link to share personal interests with other family members of various ages. Parents with demanding careers and day schedules appreciate older relatives that offer to fill the gaps by providing mentoring time with their kids. After-school activities are the ideal environment to fill in for grateful working parents. Demonstrate an interest in children’s sporting activities, science project or scouting field trips, and offer to tag along or chaperone at the next organized event.

Pitch in with details at family meals and gatherings. Help with meal preparations, or learn a video game to interact with the kids while reaffirming your vitality. Be open to learning about the fantasy world of children’s characters if your grandson expresses his enthusiasm for Buzz Lightyear, and consider dressing in costume with the kids for Halloween activities or special events. Family vacations increase the benefits of spending leisure time with the entire family in a relaxed setting, such as a cruise or seaside cottage rental, while providing ample postcard moments that everyone can look back on and appreciate.

With age comes respect, and perhaps a few other benefits. Pull the age card when all else fails to enjoy the perks of seniority and to receive special favors from younger relatives that you miss seeing on a regular basis. For example, if you would like your grandson to pay you a visit and hopefully, help bathe your dog, don’t be afraid to ask. Extend the courtesy by letting him know how much you enjoy seeing him and invite him to have lunch with you. In return, you’ll probably receive his appreciation, and a bath for Waldo.",,"2020-05-30 17:23:21",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/making-the-intergenerational-blended-family-work/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1481929495114.jpeg,1481929495114,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1481929495114.jpeg,,Caregiving,,"activities|age|ages|aging|attitude|cultures|enjoy|families|family|family members|halsell|halsell and leaf|kids|leaf|offer|sense|time|vilcabamba|village|villagers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3881,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2018-07-30|2018-05-30|2019-05-30,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,BB|Divi|3.0.106,hourly,,,,1,42,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",making-the-intergenerational-blended-family-work,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 17:45:58",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3884,"Oil Pulling: Healthy Mouth – Healthy You?","They say that conventional dental care can sometimes cause more harm than good and that treatments such as mercury dental fillings, root canals, and fluoride applications to reduce cavities are now being linked to cancer, heart disease, and auto-immune illnesses?

By paying closer attention to your mouth, you can help detect and prevent the onset of many systemic diseases that can affect the entire body. Mouth lesions may be early indicators of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Some researchers suspect that inflammation in other parts of the body is linked to periodontitis (gum disease).

Consider the benefits of using coconut and sesame oil to purge toxins by including a ten minute <a href=""http://oilpullingbenefits.org/oil-pulling-with-coconut-oil-benefits/"">oil-pulling</a> technique in your daily routine to benefit from numerous positive results. According to a book entitled, “Oil Pulling Therapy,” (Fife, 2008), all diseases begin in the mouth and the reason why oil pulling actually works is because bacteria in your mouth is attracted to the oils. With regular oil pulling, the book says you can expect several of the following results:

Dr. Fife describes our mouths as tropical rain forests with approximately 600 types of bacteria present and ready to transfer to other parts of our bodies, such as our skin and intestines. By ridding our mouths of toxins, we minimize their effect on our health before any permanent damage is done.

3892,"Curious When You Should Retire???","How much money is enough? How much is more than enough? When you should retire ? Determining when to draw the line in the sand may very well depend on the shifting tide of economic factors, including any retirement packages you may be entitled to. Weigh the options against your outstanding debts to help with the decision process. If a mortgage, tuition or other expenses have got you juggling bills and paychecks, you may want to delay retirement, especially if it means a reduction in income. Remember to factor in the costs of regular travel and entertainment, since retirement should include a healthy dose of fun and adventure.

Consider the advantages of working a few more years to level your financial playing field while adding more to your wealth portfolio in the process. If you’re in line for a well over-due promotion, don’t pass on it because you’re close to retirement. In fact, lobby for the promotion and make sure you activate the retirement package to maximize insurance coverage and long-term benefits, such as profit-sharing. Insurance costs and deductibles are minimal while you’re on the payroll, whereas, they can add a huge monthly expense to your balance sheet if Medicare hasn’t kicked in yet. Dwell on the benefits of working through most of your sixth decade as you clear old debts and prepare for a financially secure retirement.

If you decide to draw Social Security benefits while still working, you may be able to earn around $15,000 per calendar year while collecting Social Security without losing any benefits. An article by<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2011/02/15/the-big-decision-when-to-take-social-security/""> Forbes</a> shares insights about the “break-even” age - the age you have to live to in order to justify waiting to collect a bigger check. The article suggests considering that your break-even age depends on the discount rate you apply when valuing future benefits. (The higher the discount rate, the longer it takes for you to break even by deferring benefits) For example, by using a 2% real discount rate, waiting until 66, instead of taking benefits at 62, pays off if you live until around 80; using a 4% rate you must live until 84.

Visit the <a href=""http://www.socialsecurity.gov/"">Social Security</a> website to register online and use their benefits estimator to get an overview of projected monthly benefits beginning at the age of 62. Consider the financial benefits of waiting until you reach the age of 65, or if you are still willing and able to work, delay receiving benefits until the age of 70 to maximize your monthly benefit. Study the guidelines of Social Security to determine how benefits affect your bottom line now and in the future. You can receive your maximum benefit at age 70, but can begin as early as the age of 62.

A retirement plan overhaul could be the pivotal point of change for future retirees and has been discussed off and on, as a national directive and is being promoted by <a href=""http://www.retirement-usa.org/?partner=YahooEA"">Retirement USA</a> , along with other organizations, since the Social Security trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2037. The proposal includes several robust initiatives, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Universal coverage for every worker</li>
 	<li>A secure retirement with a guaranteed stream of income</li>
 	<li>Adequate retirement income for life</li>
 	<li>Shared responsibility for the cost between employers, employees and government</li>
 	<li>Contributions should be pooled and professionally managed</li>
 	<li>No payouts until retirement for any reason except permanent disability</li>
 	<li>Guaranteed lifetime payouts for workers, spouses and partners</li>
 	<li>Portability of benefits that allows workers to move their accounts between employers</li>
 	<li>Optional additional voluntary contributions by workers.</li>
 	<li>Efficient and transparent administration and management of funds</li>
</ul>
It’s encouraging to know there are some watchdogs with muscle behind the initiatives that can affect real change in the coming years and give us all a better shot at covering the cost of living longer. I encourage you to stay up-to-date on changes within the system that can affect your plan, for better or worse.

When deciding whether you are ready to retire, examine the inner workings of your typical work week and ask yourself a few key questions, such as:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>Could the stress of a working life be deadly in its own way?</em></strong> For some the answer would be “yes,” but research suggests that too little stress might also be a killer. While some retirees live active, healthy lives, peppering their days with tennis matches and volunteer work, others languish in front of the television. The everyday routine of getting up, going to work, interacting with colleagues, and striving for professional goals can keep people more physically and mentally fit than a quiet, yet dull retirement. (Continuing to make money also doesn’t hurt.)</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Do you have a reason to quit working</em></strong><em>? </em>Let’s face it. Most everyone envisions the day they don’t have to punch a time clock or answer to the rigors and demanding schedule of a dedicated, life-long career. Perhaps you are looking forward to just kicking back without answering to anyone. But are you prepared to kick back for 30, or even 40 years? Take the time to consider your long-term goals <em>before</em> retirement to help set the course from the very beginning for a more fulfilling retirement. Don’t waste your well-earned days, weeks and years on a sedentary lifestyle. To the victor go the spoils, which includes living an independent and active life.</li>
</ul>
A strategy that you may want to adapt is to work longer to live healthier, and with good reason. A comprehensive study in the UK revealed that early retirement could increase the likely onset of depression and other diseases. “There should be no 'normal' retirement age in the future,” Edward Datnow, chairman of the Age Endeavor Fellowship in the UK, was quoted as saying in a UK publication of “<a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/work-longer-live-healthier-how-retirement-can-seriously-damage-your-health-8618317.html"">The Independent</a>.” The study claims that remaining actively employed should be a government-endorsed initiative because it increases the quality of life for most people.

Consider a more nuts-and-bolts approach when deciding on when you are ready to retire. Use an online <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/retirement/tools/retirement-planning-calculator?showsmscrim=true"">retirement planning calculator</a> to determine how close you are to your financial goals. What’s interesting about these types of estimators is the fact that they only extend to the age of 90. People are living longer now - <em>sometimes 20 or 30 years longer than their parents</em>, and that leaves some lacking the extra savings necessary to support the extra years.

When discussing your financial future with an advisor, let them know you want the numbers to extend to your 100th year. It will inspire you to continue planning ahead for the magic number.

If you know how much money you need in the bank to comfortably retire, you're in the minority: “<em>Only 1 in 10 people have bothered to make the calculation</em>,” according to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. That might explain why, on average, Americans are on track to replace 60 percent or less of their income during retirement. Financial advisers generally agree that retirees need to replace 80 percent or more. Luckily, most Boomers will receive a huge to moderate transfer of wealth through inheritance, since USA Today reports that 2 out of 3 Boomers will inherit around $64,000.00 from their parents one day.

In the big picture, pay close attention to the small details, such as health care costs, that can sabotage the best-laid retirement plans. If you are relishing a future that doesn’t include daily commutes or too many late nights at the office, be sure you’ve done the math to make it a permanent transition. If the numbers don’t add up, consider delaying the start of your golden years until they do and also factor in the unknown element – such as a long-term illness.

There is no universal solution to control the costs of health care for boomers and seniors, as countries of the developed world have universally adopted the idea of caring for the elderly, and over the decades, have begun to feel the financial strain of a growing retired population. Governments need new solutions to support retirees because of the shrinking number of caregivers and trained active workforce, lower fertility rates, and the fact that seniors live longer now than their predecessors did.

<a href=""http://www.aarp.org/"">AARP’s</a> Public Policy Institute has conducted extensive research on this modern problem, discussing the possible changes that could lead to greater financial health for funding of old age insurance in every country. They have even gone a step further and created a <a href=""http://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/the-aarp-healthcare-costs-calculator/"">healthcare-costs-calculator</a> to estimate the cost of premiums, deductibles and coinsurance requirements.

Discussions about healthcare go hand-in-hand with Medicare and how it affects your out-of-pocket expenses. Learning the ins and outs of Medicare coverage is worth your time, as mistakes, especially regarding Plan D coverage for prescriptions, can be costly. According to the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> (CMS), there are several things you should do prior to initiating coverage.
<ul>
 	<li>Fill out an ""Initial Enrollment Questionnaire"" (IEQ) so your bills are paid correctly and on time. You can also complete the IEQ online at <a href=""mymedicare.gov"">mymedicare.gov</a><a href=""https://www.mymedicare.gov/"">.</a></li>
 	<li>Fill out an Authorization Form if you want your family or friends to be able to call Medicare on your behalf. Medicare can't give personal health information about you to anyone unless you give permission in writing first.</li>
 	<li>Make a ""Welcome to Medicare"" preventive visit appointment during the first 12 months you have Medicare. The free, one-time comprehensive ""Welcome to Medicare"" preventive visit puts you in control of your health and your Medicare from the start.</li>
 	<li>Sign up for <a href=""MyMedicare.gov"">MyMedicare.gov</a>, their secure online service allows you to access your personal Medicare information, including tracking your claims, viewing your eligibility information, summary notices, and to learn more about your Medicare plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D)</li>
 	<li>Choose and join a Medicare Drug Plan (Part D) during the 7-month period that starts 3 months before the month you turn 65 (this includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65).</li>
</ul>
Also, if you helped to cover health-related expenses for someone else, or received help financially, including the cost of insurance deductibles, prescriptions, home health care expenses, be sure to include out-of-pocket payments on annual tax returns to benefit from a potential <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/caregiver-tax-deductible/"">Caregiver-tax-deductible</a>.

Check out my Medicare tips below, shared during an interview I did with <a href=""http://www.grandparents.com/money-and-work/insurance-matters/tips-simplify-open-enrollment-medicare-plan-d"">Grandparents Magazine</a>.

<strong>Tip No.1: Remember to Enroll for Part D:</strong>

<em>There still are people who think enrollment is automatic, and while in some cases that may be true for Medicare Parts A and B, it is never true for Medicare Part D. Every year we have the option to update our Medicare Part D plan during open enrollment. If you haven’t finalized your decision for the Plan D coverage that will cover your prescriptions because you find the process overwhelming, you’re not alone. But taking the time to figure out which plan is for you, can save you hundreds of dollars. </em>

<strong>Tip No. 2: Know what’s New</strong>

<em>There are some exciting changes, including expanded coverage for obesity and diabetes screening to help many lower health care costs as you simultaneously improve the quality of your health</em>.

<strong>Tip No.3: Ask for Help</strong>

<em>Discuss your options with professionals, such as your regular care physician and his staff or your local pharmacist, who have first-hand knowledge of your prescription and coverage requirements. Contact your insurance provider for an appointment to review your coverage and ask a family member to sit in on the discussion. Request a detailed printout of your most recent medical receipts to anticipate the costs that may lie ahead. Research the advantages and benefits of specific plans and choose the one the most suites your health care needs.</em>

<strong>Tip No. 4: Use a Plan Finder</strong>

<em>Online search tools are your friends! They’re great for helping you sift through all the options out there to find the most cost-effective plan and they’re easy to use. You enter basic information, like your zip code and the medications you take, and the system will compare all the available plans for you. Medicare has one, as do other companies, like Walmart.</em>

<strong>Tip No. 5: Understand the Importance of Preferred Pharmacies</strong>

<em>A pharmacy accepted as “preferred” by a Medicare Part D Plan is a network pharmacy that offers covered drugs to plan members at lower out-of-pocket costs than what the member would pay at a non-preferred network pharmacy. This can make a huge difference in what you’ll pay. For example, Walmart is a preferred pharmacy on multiple plans, including the Humana-Walmart Preferred Rx Plan. They provide access to the top ten hypertension drugs for just one cent. So if you’re one of the 70% of Americans over the age of 65 who have high-blood pressure, you can get a month’s worth of the medication you need for just one penny!   Just one specific example of how it can pay to do your homework.</em>

There needs to be a better acknowledgement that paying for health care in retirement is a pretty major issue. The next step is to do an estimate to anticipate the costs and incorporate it into the plan.

It’s certain there are many factors at work that will influence the future of health care. To keep pace with the insurance industry changes, do an annual check-up to seek out the best coverage and health care available and make sure you aren’t paying for extra costs, such as prescriptions and monthly premiums associated with a pre-existing condition, although technically that shouldn’t be the case. Also be aware that drug costs change drastically between plans. Switching coverage may also mean a change in care providers. If you’re committed to your personal physician or other specialists, make sure your insurance provider agrees before making a switch.

If you haven’t finalized your decision for the Plan D coverage that will cover your prescriptions because you find the process overwhelming, you’re not alone. But taking the time to figure out which plan is for you, can save you hundreds of dollars. </p>
<p>Tip No. 2: Know what’s New</p>
<p>There are some exciting changes, including expanded coverage for obesity and diabetes screening to help many lower health care costs as you simultaneously improve the quality of your health.</p>
<p>Tip No.3: Ask for Help</p>
<p>Discuss your options with professionals, such as your regular care physician and his staff or your local pharmacist, who have first-hand knowledge of your prescription and coverage requirements. Contact your insurance provider for an appointment to review your coverage and ask a family member to sit in on the discussion. Request a detailed printout of your most recent medical receipts to anticipate the costs that may lie ahead. Research the advantages and benefits of specific plans and choose the one the most suites your health care needs.</p>
<p>Tip No. 4: Use a Plan Finder</p>
<p>Online search tools are your friends! They’re great for helping you sift through all the options out there to find the most cost-effective plan and they’re easy to use. You enter basic information, like your zip code and the medications you take, and the system will compare all the available plans for you. Medicare has one, as do other companies, like Walmart.</p>
<p>Tip No. 5: Understand the Importance of Preferred Pharmacies</p>
<p>A pharmacy accepted as “preferred” by a Medicare Part D Plan is a network pharmacy that offers covered drugs to plan members at lower out-of-pocket costs than what the member would pay at a non-preferred network pharmacy. This can make a huge difference in what you’ll pay. For example, Walmart is a preferred pharmacy on multiple plans, including the Humana-Walmart Preferred Rx Plan. They provide access to the top ten hypertension drugs for just one cent. So if you’re one of the 70% of Americans over the age of 65 who have high-blood pressure, you can get a month’s worth of the medication you need for just one penny!   Just one specific example of how it can pay to do your homework.</p>
<p>There needs to be a better acknowledgement that paying for health care in retirement is a pretty major issue. The next step is to do an estimate to anticipate the costs and incorporate it into the plan.</p>
<p>It’s certain there are many factors at work that will influence the future of health care. To keep pace with the insurance industry changes, do an annual check-up to seek out the best coverage and health care available and make sure you aren’t paying for extra costs, such as prescriptions and monthly premiums associated with a pre-existing condition, although technically that shouldn’t be the case. Also be aware that drug costs change drastically between plans. Switching coverage may also mean a change in care providers. If you’re committed to your personal physician or other specialists, make sure your insurance provider agrees before making a switch.</p>

<ol>
 	<li>Older brains are better able to utilize both brain hemispheres at once, calling on the full spectrum of brain power available.</li>
 	<li>Research proves that older adults are better able to process and solve interpersonal dilemmas, and that their people skills are sharper the younger groups.</li>
 	<li>Experience sharpens problem-solving and reasoning skills, accounting for the gradual improvement in financial decisions as we mature and age.</li>
 	<li>Emotional control is more easily achieved between the ages of 61 and 81, as we gain better strategies to handle impulsiveness.</li>

Historically notable figures that have made significant contributions well beyond the over 65 mark includes acclaimed architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, who remained active in his field until his death, shortly before his 92<sup>nd</sup> birthday. The artistic icon, Picasso, died at the age of 91, with paint stains encrusted beneath his fingernails. At a time when the average life expectancy was 35 years, Galileo, lived to the ripe age of 74, publishing his last paper only a few years earlier.

3922,"Senior Exercise: How To Stay Fit After 55","<h3>Senior Exercise Tips</h3>
A healthy person can enjoy everything that life has to offer, by working smarter and harder to stave off disease and illness. When in our youth we don’t appreciate the wonder that our body is. The body is a machine that is capable of recovering from diseases faster, move better and allows us to do all the amazing things that make life worth living. But as time goes on our body starts to slow down, which makes senior exercise so important in later life. Without exercise we become more prone to injury and illness and can easily become exhausted, here are some senior exercise tips to help stay fit after 55:
<h3>GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT</h3>
<i>""The food you eat can be either the safest and the most powerful medicine or the slowest form of poison""</i> - <b>Ann Wigmore</b>
It is a well-known fact that food has an impact on human behavior. Food is partially responsible for the release hormones which control emotions such as anger, happiness, stress, and others. Due to this medical professionals advised eating a healthy balanced diet. Eating in moderation has additional benefits such as, it can improve one’s mood, lead to a good-night sleep as well it can increase the labido.

Fruits are rich in fiber, fats, proteins and other vital nutrients that are essential for keeping the body fit. They are delicious and are a great alternative to processed sugars, but should still be eaten in moderation.

It is important to avoid carbonated sodas, fast foods, junk food, oily foods, etc. as these may affect your health in varied ways.
<h3>CALCIUM</h3>
A real worry some people have is that as we age our body gets more delicate. This is partial due to a loss of <a href=""https://www.everydayhealth.com/senior-health/osteoporosis/7-ways-improve-bone-health-after-age-50/"">calcium in the bones</a> as we age because 99% of the body's calcium is located in the bones and teeth. During childhood as we grow, our bones get bigger and stronger. Bone is constantly being broken down and rebuilt and calcium is needed for the process. But once we reach our final height during our 20’s the amount of calcium lessens. This loss can lead to joints and knees problems as we age and can cause bones to lose their original strength and become more brittle. If you worry about having brittle bones or joints try some senior exercises that are low impact, like swimming for your workout. That being said check with your doctor and see if you might need a vitamin supplement to keep your bones strong.
<h3>I LIKE TO MOVE IT MOVE!</h3>
Our body is like a machine which needs to be constantly used, maintained and refueled to keep working properly. Exercise will help keep your body stay agile and and strong, and can even help you look younger and feel better. Various types of senior exercises have been invented to make a well-toned and strong, healthy body. Your body does not remain as vigorous as it was before 55, so it is advisable to do light exercises like isometric exercises ( <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/dr-approves-new-exercise-programs-50/"">Exercise Program for 50+</a>). These exercises are designed to exercise your muscles and to retain strength and flexible without worry about damaging the ligaments and bones. These are perfect senior exercise that offer zero cramping and are completely safe for people of any age.

With the increase in the age, the muscles of an adult can become fatigued and achy, due to the lack of proper exercise and diet. Yoga addresses muscle flexibility and breathing techniques, these are necessity for senior especially those that do less of walking during the day. Yoga can be practiced in a different positions including a wide range of motions making it a great senior exercise.
<h3>THE BRAIN IS THE MOST POWERFUL MUSCLE OF ALL</h3>
Keeping the brain actively engaged helps to keep a healthy lifestyle at any age but is even more important in the elderly. Once you have reached age 55 some mental function can occur and make you feel as if you are slowing down, but it is entirely possible to maintain your mental health in your senior years. This can be achieved through the reading of novels, newspapers, comics or playing simple brain-teaser games like chess, crossword puzzles, sudoku and so on. This will enhance your memory and also keep your brain sharp.

Stress is a very harmful mental disease that not only affects the memory but also can seriously affect the metabolism of the body. Problems with ones metabolism can lead to various cardiac issues and even heart attacks or death in extreme cases. The burdens of stress that stems from a lifetime of responsibilities doesn’t magic stop just because someone gets older or retires. this doesn’t mean that you can’t find new ways to deal with that stress though.

There is a form of interactive sessions for aging people living in a retirement communities that come together to answer questions and share experience about their childhood or adulthood. This is called reminiscing therapy and it is good for cognitive functionality. For individual seniors who are less inclined to be social, they can still enjoy the benefits that come from reminiscing either through writing a memoir or creating a scrapbook with memories from the past. Think of these are senior exercises for the brain.",,"2020-07-31 15:25:05",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=3922,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Senior-Exercise-How-To-Stay-Fit-Even-After-55.jpg,"Senior woman with people exercising in fitness studio",814885,,"senior exercise",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Senior-Exercise-How-To-Stay-Fit-Even-After-55.jpg,,Longevity,,"age|body|bones|brain|calcium|due|exercise|exercise tips|exercises|food|healthy|life|mental|move|senior|senior exercise|senior exercise tips|senior exercises|stress|strong",,,,,,,91,,senior-exercise-how-to-stay-fit-even-after-55,"senior exercise",,"As time goes on our body starts to slow down, which makes senior exercise so important in later life.

3928,"How Much Assisted Living Costs? A Quick Overview","During a child's developing years, parents will take care of the child well into adulthood. In the past many of these children would in turn help their parents as they entered their twilight years. This is still considered the norm in many countries and cultures, but what if the child doesn’t have the means to help support an elderly parent? What happens if the child can barely maintain their lifestyle and take care of their household? With the changes in the job and housing markets less and less children are able to help their parents financially as they might have once be able to. Regardless seniors will need this support and care to stay healthy and must be aware of assisted living cost as it might be their only viable option.
<h3>Where can they go?</h3>
Not all families have the space or money to help support seniors, and assisted living can be a perfect option for seniors with fewer people to provide the support or care they may need at home. Assisted living costs vary depending on the type of facility in question. Assisted living communities are designed to aid residents in their daily activities such as dressing, bathing, grooming, using the restroom and more. This can be achieved through the work of home aide assistance that is made available in the residence. Occasionally, basic medication assistance is rendered to the residents but note that it’s totally different from a nursing home. An assisted living community may be a continuous care <a href=""https://www.retirenet.com/top100/"">retirement community</a> or a stand-alone residence but always offer homelike atmosphere.
<h3>What are assisted living costs?</h3>
Just going off the name assisted living, it’s possible to think it will require a huge amount of money but the biggest surprise is just how affordable it can be when compared with living at home. Just like real estate or goods and services, assisted living costs varies from location to location following the law of supply and demand. There is no direct answer, but according to Genworth Cost of Care Survey 2017, the national median for assisted living cost is estimated to be $3,750 per month equivalent to $45,000 annually.

Research has shown that assisted cost of living varies from state to state, below is the averaged monthly median of assisted living costs in some different states:
<ul>
 	<li>Alaska – $6,000</li>
 	<li>Georgia – $2,703</li>
 	<li>New Jersey – $5,994</li>
 	<li>Alabama – $2,600</li>
 	<li>Delaware – $5,533</li>
 	<li>Kentucky – $2,720</li>
 	<li>Connecticut – $5,000</li>
 	<li>Massachusetts – $4,950</li>
 	<li>Missouri – $2,288</li>
 	<li>Michigan – $2,850</li>
</ul>
It isn’t just the location that determines the assisted living cost though, other determining factors include facilities present in the apartment and community at large, size of the apartment, level of care required and additional fees charged by the assisted living communities upon move-in.

4390,"Boomer Consumer Part 1: Size and Market Potential","By 2020 the median age in the United States will be approximately 38 years old. That number will steadily increase to 40 years of age by 2030, when it is expected to plateau. Furthermore, by 2030 one out of every five people in the United States will be over 65 years of age. Interestingly, life expectancy in the U.S. has dropped again this year following last year’s decline, which marked the first downturn in more than two decades. On average, Americans can now expect to live for 78.5 years. Women can expect to live a full five years longer than men: 81 years versus 76 years. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the average life expectancy will reach 84 years of age by 2050. 

Baby boomers are a designated group of people who were born between 1946 and 1964. They are labeled “baby boomers” because, during this period of time, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of births that occurred. Today, primarily due to immigration, there are an astonishing 81.5 million boomers in the United States, more than 25% of the total population. The baby boomer generation is rivaled in size only by millennials—many of whom are the children of boomers. The millennial generation, born in the period from 1977 through 1994, consists of approximately 80 million Americans.  

Baby boomers have shaped the cultural landscape for more than 60 years and will continue to have a significant influence on our society as they move through their so-called “retirement” years. One of the most defining characteristics of the baby boomer generation is that there are actually few defining characteristics that apply to this group. That being said, here are a number of ways that boomers have differentiated themselves from other cohorts:

	Just as boomers revolutionized our society in their youth, they're also expected to transform what it means to age in America. Most experts who study this demographic agree that the way boomers will live out their retirement years will look very different from the historical, stereotypical image of senior citizens. Medical advances will enable boomers to live longer than any generation that's come before them, so rather than fading into the background of our society, more boomers will remain vibrant and active throughout their retirement years than was the case in previous generations.
  
	Boomers have always been known for going against social norms, and some of their actions included experimentation with drugs, a liberal expression of their sexuality, a renewed interest in women's rights, recognition of environmental concerns and a preference for rock and roll music. All of these characteristics, among others, shaped and defined the baby boomers’ generational identity and they are often associated with a rejection or redefinition of traditional values.

	Many boomers are pursuing second careers or taking on part-time jobs, partly out of financial necessity but also because boomers likely derived a great deal of satisfaction from their previous careers and professional accomplishments. Just because they've reached traditional retirement age doesn't mean that those opportunities to learn, earn and grow have to stop. Boomers want to continue contributing to society, although not necessarily in a traditional job setting, so they will be more likely to embrace the opportunity to pass on what they've learned to younger generations by taking part in activities like volunteering.  

	Boomers are savvier, more discerning consumers than previous generations of seniors. Their cohort size and buying power prompted companies to ramp up production of consumer goods, which multiplied their options for everything from cars to socks. Furthermore, they typically had money for these items, given that they're more likely than their parents and grandparents' generations to live in dual-income households, resulting in more income being spent on the myriad of consumer goods at their disposal. These dynamics shaped boomers into status-conscious, sophisticated shoppers.

4397,"Boomer Consumer Part 2: Characteristics, Values, and Motivations","Although they are certainly not a homogeneous group - baby boomers characteristics, values and motivations tend to be very different from other generations. This rock and roll generation has been a major force for social change in the United States. Their epic numbers and independent spirits have influenced everything from politics to pop culture, transformed the makeup of the American family and workforce, reshaped societal norms, and created our modern notion of consumerism. If one word were to be attributed to the boomer cohort, it would be “rebellion.” Through various social movements, tech movements, and health and fitness movements, boomers have redefined societal norms in countless ways.

<strong>Social Movements:</strong> As teenagers, boomers fought for their own individual freedoms, such as gender equality and civil rights, not to mention their experimentation with drugs and the sexual revolution they stirred. These experiences have taught them to be cynical of authority, that fun and personal pleasure are important, and that youth should be respected.

<strong>Tech Movements:</strong> Over the course of their lifetimes, boomers have seen and played a role in many vast technological changes. They saw a man walk on the moon and lived through the transition of every American household buying their own television. These experiences showed them that the progress of technology can vastly improve lives. It has also instilled in them the value of adaptability and the belief that humans can do anything.

<strong>Health and Fitness Movements:</strong> Boomers witnessed the massive shift in attitudes toward health. They lived through the commercialization of fitness and the popularization of healthy eating. These experiences helped them recognize the importance of keeping themselves healthy–physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Boomers understand that good health isn’t a result of luck but, instead, dedication and hard work.

<strong>Media Outlets:</strong> Baby boomers were the first generation for which television became a central part of their lives. They were able to witness news as it happened and enjoy diverse entertainment never before available in such a medium. However, baby boomers were also the first to be pervasively bombarded by advertising, which quickly capitalized upon the rapt television audience. Everything from what you should wear to how you should smell and what should be on your dinner table was pounded into receptive and somewhat defenseless heads.

<strong>Heavy Debt:</strong> Being a baby boomer has not always meant wealth or financial security. The credit card economy took root among a generation that preferred to have things now rather than save and wait until they could afford them. The parents of baby boomers tended to save up for purchases, while boomers used credit cards with abandon. Although boomers enjoy the highest income of any age group, they believe it is harder to get ahead than it was ten years ago.

<strong>Working Longer and Harder:</strong> Job competition is fierce among this group, partly due to the sheer number of members but also because of multiple economic upheavals, including changes in the nature of work due to increased automation and the movement of some jobs offshore. It is more and more difficult for those over 50 to find employment. Once they lose or leave a job, it generally takes older workers much longer to become re-employed. Despite their great strides in the workplace, many boomers rate their overall professional quality of life as lower than other generations.

4407,"Generational Differences In The Workplace - Opportunity or Challenge?","There's no doubt that our generational differences can make us stronger - if we simply work together. Creating a supportive workplace environment - <em>across generations</em> - can sometimes prove to be a difficult task.

<strong>Stereotyping is a Teamwork Killer! </strong>Research shows that humans are naturally hardwired to stereotype. A ""glimpse"" of a person is enough for our brains to create judgment and each of us is inherently part of a social subset that has some (<em>perhaps latent)</em> negative stereotype attached to our subconscious. At times this disposition proves to be quite prevalent in a multi-generational workplace environment. For instance, older employees are often preconceived to be slower workers who are hard set against change. They are thought to be passive learners and scared of technology. Younger employees are frequently labeled as lazy employees who don’t stay loyal to a company, and want to be constantly praised. It's important to be aware of the dangerous consequences of these stereotypes. This type of natural inclination to adopt a ""perception"" based on perhaps marketing, group think or the media is often referred to as <strong><i>stereotype threat. </i></strong>According to the ""fount of knowledge"" <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat"">wikipedia</a><i> (and the plethora of sources provided within)</i> stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are (<em>or feel themselves to be</em>) at risk of conforming to stereotypes about their social group. Stereotype threat is purportedly a contributing factor to long-standing racial and gender gaps in academic performance. It can have detrimental effects on the performance of individuals belonging to negatively stereotyped subsets - especially in the workplace. Something to think about next time you ""side-eye"" one of your co-workers for no reason at all!

<strong>Understanding the Different Generations...</strong>From the surface it can seem difficult for business leaders and managers to get the four generations, who grew up in completely different environments, to collaborate and communicate effectively together. But it isn’t an impossible task to foster cohesion among what may seem like very fragmented groups. The first step to avoid commotion and collision between multigenerational employees, and to get the whole staff working together, is to better understand what shaped them to be who they are in the first place. Taking the time to learn what shapes your employees within each generation can help you identify their underlying values, needs, attitudes and motivational buttons. With this insight you will be able to implement strategies that connect you to the core values of each of the cohorts and hopefully avoid misunderstandings across generations.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>The Silent Generation:</strong> They are the members of the Veteran generation who survived the Great Depression and World War II. They are known for staying quiet, laying low and working hard, hence the moniker “Silent"" generation. They are the children of war who grew up during lean times. Silents value hard work and sacrifice and have always considered any promising opportunities a privilege. They are loyal to their employers and respect authority. Silents believe respect, wealth, status and reward should be earned not just given (<em>or a given</em>).</li>
 	<li><strong>Baby Boomers:</strong> This generation grew up in an era that was defined by events like the Vietnam War, Women’s Liberation Movement, Civil Rights Movement and Space exploration. Boomers value relationships and strong interpersonal skills because they grew up without technology (<em>translated as:</em> <em>they actually had ""direct eye contact"" with other humans on a regular basis</em>). The majority of baby boomers are adept at tech now, but research suggests they prefer to use technology to stay productive rather than for staying connected. This generation believes in working long hours, and essentially created “Corporate America”, and the culture of face-to-face meetings in the workplace.</li>
 	<li><strong>Generation X:</strong> This group is also known as the ""sandwich generation"" because they are right in the middle of two prominent generations - The Baby Boomers and the Generation Y. Whereas Baby Boomers are defined as workaholics, Generation X are more focused on creating a work-life balance. Data supports the concept that is this is the era where the ""latch key kid""  moniker was established <em>(the term refers to a child who is at home without adult supervision for some part of the day, especially after school until a parent returns from work</em>) which has enhance their level of confidence and allowed them to feel more secure and independent. GenXer's value career security more than job security, and like being self reliant. Being entrepreneurial is a side-effect of this need to be dependent on no one except themselves.</li>
 	<li><strong>Generation Y:</strong> This generation is predominantly defined by technology. They look forward to, and fully embrace, innovation. They prefer communicating through text and emails rather than face-to-face interactions, which tends to hurt their interpersonal skills (<em>especially when they are attempting to co-exist with older co-workers</em>). They are changing the traditional structure of corporate America. Members of the GenY group are confident and aren’t afraid of questioning their authorities and they are always seeking new challenges.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Generational Differences in Workplace: </strong>Robert Half Management Resources looked at the how various generations differ in the workplace and the results aren't earth shattering - they are fairly predictable based on the various cohorts characteristics (<em>or are those actually stereotypes that we have adopted?</em>). The participants, including more than 2,200 CFOs, were asked the question - <em>“In which one of the following areas do you see the greatest differences among your company's employees who are from different generations?”  </em>

<strong><em>Their answers....</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Communication skills- 30%</li>
 	<li>Adapting to change- 26%</li>
 	<li>Technical Skills- 23%</li>
 	<li>Cross-departmental collaboration- 14%</li>
 	<li>7% of the respondents mentioned seeing no difference</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>Some context...</strong></em>.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Communication Skills: </strong>Baby Boomers normally prefer ""in-person"" interactions and are more “reserved” than their counterparts; Generation Y prefer a collaborative means of communication over an authoritative style. Y are more receptive to coaching, and crave feedback 50% more than other employees.</li>
 	<li><strong>Change Adoption: </strong>Generation X and Y look at change as a “vehicle to new opportunities.” Although the research didn’t mention Baby Boomer’s attitude in this area, other studies have shown that they are more resistant to organizational change. Since Baby Boomers value communication, one of the ways to increase their readiness to change is to verbally talk them through the situation and make sure they understand why the change is necessary.</li>
 	<li><strong>Technical Skills: </strong>As expected, the survey showed that Baby Boomers and Generation X'ers prefer learning via traditional methods, while millennials prefer collaborative or tech-driven options. The younger workforce grew up with tech as their third appendage, so this result is very much expected.</li>
 	<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>The silent generation is mostly driven by hard work, job titles and salary. Since Baby boomers are very ambitious and goal driven, they are highly motivated by promotions, increased responsibility and recognition. Gen X'ers like doing their own thing, and are heavily influenced by flexible schedules and monetary rewards like bonuses and stock options. The millenials love stability, structure and team work. They also find a lot of value in continuing education and ongoing feedback from their supervisors.</li>
 	<li><strong>Feeling Respected: </strong>Millennials - just like the older generation - want to be respected. It should be noted that the way each generation speaks the language of feeling valued is different. Older workers like their opinions to be given more weight because they’ve more experience. The younger workers want to feel listened to even if it isn’t implemented. Another interesting point to address is that many older workers may not like when equal respect is shown to everyone, especially to an employee with less experience or a lower title.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to Make Cross-Generational Leadership Work</strong>
Grappling the friction between four generations of employees in the same workplace might seem overwhelming, but once you understand the expectations of each of these generations from their work, it becomes easier to manage and help them align with one another better.

<strong>5 Strategies to Create an ""Employee- Friendly"" Cross-Generational Workplace </strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Encourage mentoring: </strong>Knowledge comes with experience, and due to the fact older workers and younger workers seem to be adept at different things the learning can be mutual. For instance, millennials may be <em>tech savvy</em> but mature employees hold valuable knowledge around best of practice as it relates to <em>interpersonal</em> skills. Both can benefit from on another in the realm of thoughtful communication skills! Reciprocal mentoring, a relationship structure that harnesses the power of mentoring into a mutually beneficial relationship where each participant takes turns being the mentor and the mentee (<em>regardless of age!</em>), is becoming the norm in successful organizations.</li>
 	<li><strong>Give an option to work offsite:</strong> Avoid micromanaging and offer your employees options to telecommute or work offsite. Since different generations have their own way of getting the job done, businesses should focus more on the end result rather than how their employees are getting there. Gen X and Y often report that they are more efficient when working from a coffee shop or a rented co-working space because they value flexibility. Integrating flexible working offsite options for at least a day or two a week will ensure that everyone on your team feels acknowledged and accommodated.</li>
 	<li><strong>Offer different learning styles:</strong> Traditionalists (Silents) learn their best in a “command-control” structure like lectures. Baby boomers prefer in-class set up with PowerPoint presentations, followed by a discussion and feedback session. Generation X love learning through self-directed programs where they can complete a course at their own pace, and Generation Y learn their best in hyper-personalized training course that are also self-directed. Since the younger generation grew up with tech, they like their information available to them “on-demand.” HR representatives and learning and development teams within an organization should do their best to accommodate each of these four learning styles.</li>
 	<li><strong>Encourage engagement among employees: </strong>Every employee likes their opinions to be valued and heard! There is no doubt that creating a work culture that inspires conversation will enhance employee performance. Younger employees, especially, like working in a supportive environment and aren’t afraid of changing jobs if they can find a workplace that will better allow them to have a voice. Encouraging engagement, thus, will hopefully be one feature that keeps your employee turnover rate low, and allows employees will feel more positive about sharing innovative/disruptive ideas. In a space where everyone feels heard, employees are more prone to make better decisions and give their 100%.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tailor communication to each generation:</strong> The preferred communication style varies greatly according to ones generation. Younger employees prefer digital communication, with group instant message (IM) like <a href=""https://slack.com"">SLACK</a> being their ""voice"" of choice. Older employees prefer in person, one-on-one communication, or even phone conversations (<em>YES phone!!!!</em>). Generation X, like Gen Y, like feedback, and they tend to want everyone to be treated equally, so talk to them directly about their performance regardless of their age cohort (<em>so don't dance around the feedback by using online platforms as a shield</em>).</li>
</ul>
Closing generational gaps in the workforce starts with learning about your employees needs and values. There is strength to be gained from a generationally diverse workforce, as a whole, they have stronger (<em>and varied</em>) cognitive problem-solving skills which are necessary to face the challenges arising from the disruptive and unpredictable marketplace of today!

4575,"Generational Marketing Strategy In 2019","From the early 1950s, generational marketing has been used as the key factor for business owners to consider before developing products and marketing plans aimed at potential the customers. Generational marketing is a collective study based on the psychological behaviors, attitudes, and buying habits of a group of people born between certain dates used to denote a “generation” that is studied by generational experts.

Certain circumstances, events, and even disasters took place that completely changed the vision of a generation. Based on these occurrences buying habits and viewpoints of the generations changed accordingly. The first ever observed generation was named the “Baby Boomers” born between 1946-1964. Generational authors and generational experts say that post World War II success, new industry and housing market, coupled the impact of the Korean and Vietnam Wars and the start of the Cold War, the “Nuclear Family” and civil rights movement, made this generation face a slew of new technological and social concerns and growth that has been felt even now 70 years later.

The current generation is called “Generation Z” they are the grandchildren or even the great grandchildren of the baby boomers”. This Generation grew up with technology and information at their fingertips. Often said to be addicted to social media and new technologies buy generation experts, it must be noted that Generation Z is in fact a larger portion of the populous then the Baby Boomers representing over 25% of the current population. This new generation may be considered by some to be lazy, they are in fact, well informed and are more focused on world events then past generations and are in a key position to impact the global market as the years go on say generational authors.

Here are a few generational marketing strategies, you should implement to promote sales and profits for 2018 and the future.
<h3>Web marketing:</h3>
In the vast ocean of internet, web marketing is one of the most effective ways for promoting your products and services. You may either get your own website to be developed or you can purchase advertisements on websites for your products. During a recent case study by generational experts, it was revealed that a well-designed ad can help your sales increased by up to 300%. There are generally two effective forms of digital advertisement:
• Banner Ads
• Video Ads

<strong>Banner ads:</strong>
These ads are generally in a digital text form. Billions of people around the globe hunt on blogs for research, entertainment, and other purposes with banner ads showing on nearly every page. Blogs can be about any topic and it is wise to find one that would work in conjunction with your banner ads. A well-ranked blog site can get millions of visitors a day. Promoting your products and services on a blog with good following can produce some serious worthwhile results. If you can’t find an appropriate blog it is sometimes wise to start your own talking about your business, product, and industry. Become your own generational author!

<strong>Video Ads:</strong>
Videos can captivate a huge number of customers with a well-done ad. Video ads are brief, straight-forward and fruitful when using as tools for generational marketing. Online video ads are categorized into following types:

In-stream Videos: These videos are played inside the video player that preempt the original video like the ads you may see when watching some content on YouTube. The majority of the cyber population spend 40 minutes on YouTube looking for videos. So, a single ad during a content playing can accumulate customers very quickly.

Out-stream Videos: These videos do not contain any other content besides than the product ad. such as a pop-up ad as seen on Facebook. Other examples are Interactive Video Ads, In-game ads, Companion Video ads and Web page Video Ads.
<h3>Know the Market</h3>
knowing how to reach your target market makes all the difference with generational marketing. Generation Z, for example, spends much of their time on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat. According to market research conducted by generational experts, an internet consumer spends at least 35 minutes on Facebook and 40 minutes on Snapchat everyday which is why ads on the platforms are considered so effective. Market research for specific ages and demographics can help a market plan more directly target your wanted client base.
<h3>Location, location, location</h3>
location is still vital for any business, but in the digital age you need to register your business online to promote your products along with your brick and mortar storefront if u have one. Though, Facebook, Bing Places, Foursquare people can actively search your company in these online directories. The most widely used search engine is provided by Google My Business. Google My Business provides a photographic view of your business place, chat and call option to the searcher, which can enhance your CRM, communication, and visitors to a next level. It also provides the option of the website, which makes the user jump on your website within a single click.
<h3>E-commerce and You</h3>

4596,"Millennials Are The Changing Face Of American Caregivers","The cycle of young and old ensures that today’s caregivers will need a caregiver themselves at some point in their lives. If we were asked to imagine a typical caregiver looking after the needs of a sick or an aging person, most of us would picture a man or a woman in their 70’s or 80’s, caring for their spouse. The reality is quite…young. 

There are 40 million unpaid caregivers in America, and one fourth of them, or 1 out of every 4 caregiver, is a millennial taking care of an aging baby boomers, all the while holding a job. Millennials have been boxed into several stereotypical labels. They are often misrepresented as being entitled and lazy, so this finding pretty much knocks that stereotype out the window. 
AARP conducted a study titled, “The Emerging Generation of Family Caregivers”, where they took a closer look at, among many other things, how exactly being a young caregiver affected a Millennial’s life.

<strong>Here are the 3 key findings:</strong>
<strong>Finance: </strong>1 out of every 4 millennial caregivers work, 1 in 3 of those employees earn less than $30,000 annually. 
<strong>Tasks:</strong> The tasks that millennial caregivers perform are as complex as older caregivers, and they spend 20 hours more every week providing care.
<strong>Type of Support:</strong> 1 in 3 millennial caregiver cares for someone with emotional and mental health problem. 

Some positive news about this new generation of caregivers is that men, as much as women, are stepping up to the roles of being a caretaker. Gender roles are changing and millennial men are ready to do what traditionally was boxed up as a “woman’s job.” This is great to hear because with a growing population of older adults in need, and a shortage of caregivers, we can never have too many helping hands. 

<strong>Challenges of Being a Young Millennial</strong>

During a phase of life where their friends may be focused on building a career, forming relationships, and starting a family of their own, these young caregivers spend their after-work hours taking care of an aging parent or grandparent. This can be psychologically frustrating, and thus, it isn’t surprising that 40-70% of them face symptoms of depression. 

Long distance caregivers also face overwhelming guilt when they can’t visit their loved ones who are sick frequently enough. Millennials also report that it is hard for them not worry about the possibility of mistreatment, neglect or quality of care that their loved one might be receiving from a temporary caregiver. Even if they are local they mention that it is difficult, and expensive, when they have to hire another caregiver because they can’t provide a full-days care due to other commitments.

Caregiving can be isolating, especially at an age when it’s more common to spend time having fun with friends or socializing with peers at college and work. In addition, talking to friend’s about caregiving stresses might not feel as cathartic because unless they are a caregiver, there are many things that they won’t understand. 

Navigating the healthcare system alone can be challenging too. Tasks like knowing where to obtain relevant health information, talking to medical staff, handling HIPPA barriers, and insurance issues, can be a lot to take in at any age, but especially if the caregiver is younger.
 
<strong>We All Need To Step Up</strong>

There are many things we can do to support millennials while they, putting their own dreams aside, selflessly take on the challenging role of a caregiver. Schools and universities can provide them with financial assistance for those interested in continuing their education. Many organizations like the Alzheimer’s Association and AARP already provide caregivers with resources that can help them settle into their new role with more knowledge.

Employers can help staff members who are part-time caregivers by providing a week or two of paid leave, just like AARP does for their employees with their “Caregiving Leave” and “Phased Retirement” initiative. 

<em>This sea of young caregivers is juggling their responsibilities like pros while still taking care of many. It’s not a sea of entitled souls but one full of selfless and empowered individuals. </em>

4781,"Generational Issues in the Workplace: How They Work Together","The modern workplace is a hodgepodge of four generations; the Greatest Generation, Baby Boomers Generation X, and Millennials, all have different viewpoints, interests and approaches on working and managing. How do these differences affect a company? What do these differences bring to a workplace as strengths and as weaknesses?

The Greatest Generation is at an age where most have retired or are in high positions of power in many companies. They have endured many changes to the workforce and the economic shift from manufacturing to service, they have decades worth of experiences to fall back on with knowledge learned through all those experiences. So what generational issues in the workplace might they bring? After working for so long, it could bring stubbornness and the belief that if it has worked in the past it will continue to work in the future. This is obviously not the case, as business must adapt to the times or will be left in the past and ultimately fail. Workers from this generation as still great fonts of knowledge, advice and expertise and should be respected even though few are still in the work force. (<a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/generational-expert-alexis-abramson/"">Generational Experts</a>)

More and more Baby Boomers are working past retirement causing more generational interactions which in turn cause generational issues in the workplace. Many Baby Boomers are more reserved with their interactions. This is seen by their preference for Phone calls and emails over text messages or direct messages used by younger generations. Most Boomers are in leadership positions at the workplaces that they are at. They set policy and might not understand or connect with younger generations as they have been in their positions for longer periods of time and weathered hardships. The most successful companies have adapted to those hardships though and have set up training that they feel comfortable with, seminars and workshops. While these are still used regularly, much of the Millennial and Generation Z workforce prefers more computer-based learning so they can practice the skills they are being taught. The most important thing for a Baby Boomer to know when dealing with these younger generations is that this workforce is even more well educated and technologically savvy than any other in history, and they are willing to learn more but expect to be given clear and set goals to maximize the effectiveness of the workers and avoid any generational issues in the workplace.

Generation X has been called the “lost Generation” or the Latch-key generation. This is due to that fact that this generation had little adult supervision compared to previous generations as more and more women entered the work force, and with increase of divorce rates of the times. This Generation is often in middle management positions as well as owners and entrepreneurs of small businesses. In 2015 55% of all new businesses started were started by Gen Xer’s. Known to epitomize the “work hard/play hard” mentality, Generation X put there head down and work hard to get what they want. Generational issues in the workplace are less then with older generations as they share traits with all the other working generations. Hard workers, who are well educated and a good understanding of technology. Generation X has come to job maturity in a recession and a housing market crash that many felt but not crippled by.

The youngest generation of workers are the Millennials and Generation Z. These new workers are viewed as lazy and unmotivated by many of the older generations. Millennials especially have been vilified as killers of brands and industries. This is unfair as many are facing issues stemming from crippling student debt and trying to enter a job market demanding experience and degrees for lower pay then would allow to establish themselves as older generations might have been able due to inflation. The best educated generations of workers use technology as second nature, they use this to help to solve problems, evaluate policies and come up with new ways of completing tasks and are comfortable thinking on a global scale. Generation Z is just coming into the work place and has less experience and may need more guidance in their positions but are inventive and are efficient multi-taskers. Most of the generational issues in the workplace come from the different view points between these younger generations who feel like they are forced to try, and fix issues created by older generations, and older generations not understanding the rate of change that has happened. The older generations may be set and settled after decades of working, the younger generations an often forced to work multiple jobs to earn enough to afford basic amenities due to the wages offered and the debt that was accumulated to get degrees needed to get their positions. In closing there are many pros and cons to having multiple generations in the same workforce as long as management can incorporate them all to get the best results out of all of the workers.",,"2019-10-14 14:24:51",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=4781,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/generational-issues-in-the-workplace.jpg,"generational issues in the workplace",,,"Generational Issues in the Workplace",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/generational-issues-in-the-workplace.jpg,,Uncategorized,"generation myth","baby boomers|generation|generation x|generation z|generational|generational issues|generational issues in the workplace|generations|greatest generation|issues|issues in the workplace|older generations|positions|well educated|work|work force|workers|working|workplace|younger generations",,,,,,,79,,,"generational issues in the workplace",,"Generational issues in the workplace: The modern workplace is a hodgepodge of four generations; the Greatest Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials, all have different viewpoints, interests and approaches on working and managing.

4784,"Baby Boomers and Technology","Technology is amazing, no one can deny that, but it can also be confusion because of how quickly it changes. Baby Boomers and technology sometimes feel like oil and water, they just don’t mix, but this isn’t true at all. Technology is everywhere and while the shear amount of it can be overwhelming, you can’t be afraid of it and learning how to use it is much easier then people make it out to be. Recent studies by AARP even show that more Baby Boomers are embracing technology with 7 out of 10 owning a smartphone and 9 out of 10 owning a PC or laptop. Now let’s look at how Baby Boomers and technology have changed over the years.
<h3>Baby Boomers and Technology: A Brief History</h3>
When Baby Boomers were growing up there were less technological breakthroughs that were brought into the consumer market. Computers were to large and many other advancements were medical and military in nature. This isn’t to say that there was no technology was being developed, the microwave, and color television, advancements in music mediums are all great examples of that, but they were all coming at a slower pace then today. From 1960’s to the late 1990’s much of the technology was being developed at a reasonable pace, but after 2000 and the Dot.com boom new technology snowballed. Even today we still see this increased technological development, going from solar power cars as an interesting novelty in the 1990’s to new modern self-driving electric cars of today is a HUGE leap in less than 20 years. It is understandable why Baby Boomers and technology are not integrating as fast as with the younger generations. The Millennials and Generation Z were able to grow up with these advancements happening and became used to them, while Baby Boomers and to a lesser extent Generation X went decades with out much technological change. (<a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/generational-issues-in-the-workplace-how-they-work-together/"">Generational Issues in Workplace</a>)
<h3>Baby Boomers and Technology: How It Affects Business</h3>
So why is it important to note the differences that Baby Boomers and technology have compared to other generations? Using Healthcare companies as an example we see that studies show that the average age of a CEO is 55 years old, the CFO is 52 years old and the executives are aged around 53 years old in healthcare organizations. This is notable different then the average age of a tech company in which the CEO is only 40 years old. These age differences mean that the ones in charge of companies, who are likely to be hesitant to change systems are in control of the future of company’s digital future. Many older and established doctors’ offices would rather face fines or increased insurance fees then change to newer updated systems. These attitudes limit and stifle the growth of an office and even the industry itself. Other industries face similar challenges with the increase of automated systems, computerized filing becoming more common, companies can’t just look at technology as ways of doing current things more efficiently, but as doing business in a completely new way, and not think of it as belonging to the younger generations.
<h3>Baby Boomers and Technology: How to Embrace Technology</h3>
So how can that Baby Boomers learn to embrace technology? Well the easiest way is to use it. There are classes in colleges and community centers and videos online giving step-by-step instructions. There are programs that have young people who go to community centers and retirement homes that teach seniors and Baby Boomers how to use smartphones, computers, programs and more. But what happens if you are still having issues learning, you can get one-on-one coaching. Ask questions and then practice until you feel comfortable. Don’t let up after these classes thought, have someone follow up within 2 weeks to make sure you aren’t slipping back into old habits. By embracing technology, you not only learn new skills, but you can make your life easier, and just maybe have some fun along the way.

4787,"Generation X Managers: Learners who Lead","Caught between larger generations, Generation X has been somewhat left in the shadow of the Baby Boomers and Millennials. So why are Generation X managers so important to companies? Well because this generation holds 51% of the worlds leadership roles and now they have their time to shine.

Generation X characteristically are considered by some of the best educated populations in history, with over 60 percent of their population having attended college. Because of their upbringing another Generation X managers (<a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/generational-expert-alexis-abramson/"">Generational Experts</a>) characteristic is that they are more independent, resourceful and self-sufficient, this comes from their the “latchkey generation” moniker. With the combination of the increased divorce rates and women entering the workforce in greater numbers, the children of this generation had less adult supervision and without cell phones or other ways to contact their parents, were largely left to become self-reliant at an early age. Their increase in education coincides with the shift from a manufacturing-based workforce to a service-based one, where they were well placed to accept this change by becoming the Generation X managers of these new businesses. Gen Xer’s have come to understand that many businesses need to adapt to this younger generation because Baby Boomers have been slower to retire or move out of the workforce. Leaving these potential Generation X managers to look at opportunities outside their current workplace. There reluctance to seek a managerial role in their current company is understandable if there are few opportunities for advancement or growth.

Generation X managers use their familiarity with technology in the workplace with great success to the company, themselves and their workers. Having grown up as the first generation with technology has made them more comfortable at using it and have adapted to the changes it has brought to the work place. Generation X managers are extremely capable with the uses of smart devices, laptops, tablets, email and many other technologies that has become everyday necessities in the work place. Because of there better understanding of technology Generation X managers were some of the first ones to adapt their businesses to use technology. According to research Gen Xer’s are actually more prolific social media users then the younger generations.

Like most Gen Xer’s, Generation X managers dislike being micro-managed and have a clear disdain for structured work hours, preferring a hands-off management style. Preferring to manage others as they would like to be managed Generation X managers prefer to get the work done, avoid distractions and then go home.  Being hard working, Generation X managers often become mentor figures for employees, to help encourage innovations and growth for the business and the employee.

It can be seen is that Generation X managers works to live, not live to work. As of 2010 their assets were statistically double that of their debts. Compared to Baby Boomers whose assets were 27 times more than their debts. True inflation has an impact, but this still shows that Generation X managers appreciate their free time and are more willing to spend money to make the most of it. Epitomizing the work hard/play hard mentality.  This doesn’t mean that Generation X is lazy, far from it, they have seen the largest number of startups and new business in history. In 2015 Gen Xers launched 55 percent of all the new businesses started that year. By showing to have and to share the Entrepreneurial spirit of small business this generation is set as a new focal point for all future small businesses to aspera to be like. Meaning that all these new businesses are run by more Generation X managers then ever before.",,"2018-09-15 14:42:36",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=4787,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Generation-X-Managers.jpg,"Generation X Managers",,,"Generation X Managers",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Generation-X-Managers.jpg,,"Future Trends|Generations|Lifestyle|Marketing to Boomers|Marketing to Millennials|Quick Thoughts","generation myth","adapt|baby|baby boomers|boomers|business|businesses|gen|gen xer's|generation x|generation x managers|managers|new businesses|place|preferring|technology|work|work place|workforce|x managers|xer's",,,,,,,85,,,"Generation X managers",,"Generation X Managers: Caught between larger generations, Generation X has been somewhat left in the shadow of the Baby Boomers and Millennials.

4790,"Smartphone for Seniors: What to look for in a Smartphone","Technology changes daily and the most used technology now-a-days is the smartphone. There are many things to be on the look for when you decide to get a new smartphone for seniors, screen size, brightness, ease of use, size among others. We will go over some of the best smartphones for seniors and explain the pros and cons of each. A smartphone differs greatly from a simple cell phone, cell phones are very basic with few features besides making calls or text messages, a smartphone is a palm sized computer with the internet at your fingertips.
<h3><strong>Android vs Apple</strong></h3>
When looking at smartphones for seniors you have to realize first and foremost that there are 2 main operating systems, Android and iOS. While there are others these are the most common and easy to use and find.

Android is made Google and is an open source operating system. The open source means that source code, the blueprint for the program, is made available to the public and anyone versed in the programing language and make programs that will work on it and can edit the original design to make it better.  Now this doesn’t mean someone can just get into your phone and change it, it just means that someone can agree to terms of use set forth by Google and use the base code as a starting point to improve or edit it in some way and that others can then download and use this new changed program. The Android OS is similar to the Windows OS on PC’s which many people like and can make them great smartphones for seniors.
<h3>Smartphone for Seniors: Android</h3>
The Android powered phones are considered by many to be the superior choice of phones here are some of the pros and cons of Android based phones.
<h4><strong>Pros:</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>More brand options</li>
 	<li>Prices are cheaper</li>
 	<li>Extremely customizable</li>
 	<li>More free <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/10-helpful-apps-for-seniors/"">apps</a></li>
 	<li>Better battery life</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cons:</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Differences between manufactures may cause confusion switching between phones</li>
 	<li>People don’t always set up automatic system updates and can slow down their phone</li>
 	<li>All the customizable options can be confusing</li>
</ul>
Apple if you didn’t know makes the iPhone, which is run by the iOS. The iOS is used on most of Apple products and is fairly uniform across all devices and its computers, which use a similar but different operating system.  Apple makes a sleek and stylish collection of smart devices that are updated annually with new cosmetics and features.  With it’s operating system being the same across all it’s product lines it is very easy to use but can be somewhat confusing to those that use PC’s and not Mac’s. With how easy it is iPhones make great smartphones for seniors.
<h3>Smartphone for Seniors: Apple IOS</h3>
Now here are the Apple iOS pros and cons when considering
<h4><strong>Pros: </strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Easy to use</li>
 	<li>Sleek design</li>
 	<li>Best security and privacy settings</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cons</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>More expensive</li>
 	<li>Little customization</li>
 	<li>Short battery life</li>
 	<li>Worse camera</li>
</ul>
The choice of smartphones for seniors once you’ve narrowed down the choice between the 2 types of phone is much simpler now. If you choose an iPhone, then any basic iPhone is a great choice for anyone. Easy to pick up and use from the get go, you have a limited number of choices though we recommend looking at the iPhone 7 as it is newer but the newest model, thus getting a great phone that is still current but not as expensive as the newest model.

4798,"Generation X Characteristics: A Generation of Business Professionals","Generation X is the term used to describe the age demographic born after the baby boomer generation of the 1940’s and 50’s. This generation has their birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960’s all the way up till the 80’s, but there are no exact dates. Often dubbed the “latchkey generation” because of the increased divorce rates and women entering the workforce in greater numbers. These are all contributing factors to the many Generation X characteristics.

In 2010 the U.S. Census reported approximately 84 million people were Gen Xers. One of the noted Generation X characteristics is the declining birth rates compared to their Baby Boomers counterparts. A theory about the cause of these declining birth rates from the 1960’s and 1970’s is the invention of the birth control pill that was introduced in the early 1960’s. Many women joining the work force with the introduction of daycare services and just out of necessity many of these children were left with inadequate adult supervision and become more self-reliant at an early age.
<h3>Generation X Characteristics: Education</h3>
Generation X characteristics are shaped by the fact that this generation are considered to be one of the best educated populations in history, with Over 60 percent of their population having attended college. This increase in education coincides with the shift from a manufacturing-based workforce to a service-based one. Because of their upbringing another Generation X characteristic is that they are more independent, resourceful and self-sufficient. These are all important to the change in the new economical shift. It should be noted though that many Gen Xer’s dislike being micro-managed and have a clear disdain for structured work hours, preferring a hands-off management style. Many Gen Xer’s having seen the struggles of their parents don’t retain the same sense of company loyalty as Baby Boomers, often leaving positions and companies for better opportunities
<h3>Generation X Characteristics: Technology</h3>
Like many of the other Generation X characteristics Gen Xer’s have that are used in the workplace their familiarity with technology has been a great boon to them as workers. Having grown up as the first generation with technology has made them more comfortable at using it and have adapted to the changes it has brought to the work place. Generation X characteristically are extremely capable with the uses of smart devices, laptops, tablets, email and many other technologies that has become everyday necessities in the work place.

This understanding of technology has also made them “nerds”. Many of the most prominent and influential websites like YouTube, Amazon, Google, were created by Gen Xer’s. This Generation X characteristic of creativity doesn’t just stop and websites but many popular Authors, Actors, Artist, Scientists and even Designers are Gen Xer’s. The creativity on this generation has brought many great moments of entertainment, new fashions, and new understanding of how the world works to everyone.
<h3>Generation X Characteristics: Work</h3>
Lastly one of the most important Generation X characteristics that can be seen is that Generation X works to live, not live to work. As of 2010 their assets were statistically double that of their debts. Compared to Baby Boomers whose assets were 27 times more than their debts. True inflation has an impact, but this still shows that Gen Xer’s appreciate their free time and are more willing to spend money to make the most of it. Epitomizing the work hard/play hard mentality.  This doesn’t mean that <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/generational-expert-alexis-abramson/"">Generation X</a> is lazy, far from it, they have seen the largest number of startups and new business in history.

4803,"Loneliness in Seniors: What Can You Do?","With the onset of old age, many individuals notice changes in their physical and mental health. Seniors may start to lead solitary and lonely lives. This is a serious issue and may bring about some major diseases like heart attacks, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and others.

<h3>SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM</h3>
Everyone has priorities in their life but spending quality time with your aging loved ones should be high on the list. It might be hard to make time for regular visits but it will be worthwhile.

You can also show them your photos and swap stories with one another.
<h3>GAMING OLD AND NEW</h3>
Playing games can also help combat loneliness in seniors. Board games like Chess, Go, and Backgammon can promote the growth of dendrites, a part of a brain cell which is responsible for sending signals around the body. Moreover, these games require strategy, management, and concentration, which can only be achieved in the coordination of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Furthermore, video games are proven to improving memory, focus, <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/staying-socially-connected/"">social interactions</a>, decisive decision making, and multitasking abilities.

<h3>OLD DOGS CAN LEARN NEW TRICKS</h3>
You’re never too old to learn, and learning new skills like cooking, computer courses, or even attending classes to get a G.E.D. or college degree are amazing ways to to feel accomplished. Interacting with younger people in class settings can bring about amazing new friendships and both parties can learn from each other.

<h3>WALK ABOUT</h3>
Physical <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/fun-activities-for-seniors-and-their-importance/"">activities</a> are proven to be beneficial for a good start of the day. It’s called the great outdoors for a reason; walking, driving, or even just sitting outside having a picnic can be very enjoyable. Taking a walk in a park for 15-minutes can greatly improve a person mood. Don’t rush, try and keep a slow and steady pace. This is not only good cardio but helps calm the mind, as they say stop and smell the roses. Fresh air can work wonders on a person and visiting new spots can release neuro-chemicals that trigger delight and pleasure. So get out there and enjoy the sunshine.
<h3>MAKE NEW FRIENDS</h3>
Sometimes it’s embarrassing sharing our feelings with family members. Keeping our feelings to ourselves can have negative consequences that might lead to psychological problems and even depression.

4806,"Tips For Senior Independent Living","Senior independent living has never been as comfortable and inviting as it is today. Unlike in the past, senior living and retirement communities provide various kinds of personalized care and offerings specifically fine tuned with the physical and psychological needs of each resident top of mind. Seniors can continue to maintain a level of independence by choosing the environment and lifestyle they wish to live in that fits their specific needs. The services offered by healthcare communities and senior independent living facilities are plentiful and very diverse. Some assistance is offered if needed  - for instance this service can range from frequent visits or hours of home health care offered each day. The aim is to enable seniors to live their lives as free of restrictions as possible without having to constantly rely on someone for their every move. When deciding how you want to live out your mature years - in your own home, in a retirement community, in an assisted living situation - it is critical you ask yourself a couple of important questions.
<h3>What Types of Services Do You Need?</h3>
It is important to classify the type of care you will need when looking at senior independent living facilities as the scope of health care services can vary. For instance, a wheelchair dependent seniors demands would be completely different than someone who might be battling depression or dementia. Apart from services, you should also keep in mind the type of facility and its location as it is really important to like the neighborhood where you will live. While deciding the type of services you need, you should make notes of the costs and frequency of services being offered. Select the types of health-care and domestic services that would be most appropriate for you and your physical and mental needs. For example seniors who prefer to do washing and other chores on their own might not want to spend their money on housekeeping services.

Some of the common services offered by assisted living providers are:
<ul>
 	<li>Organization and management of medical appointments</li>
 	<li>Housekeeping</li>
 	<li>Transportation</li>
 	<li>Group shopping</li>
 	<li>Three square meals a day</li>
 	<li>Managing financial matters like billing</li>
 	<li>Exercise facilities</li>
 	<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Is Your Home Safe and Secure?</h3>
Research indicates that more mature adults prefer to live in their homes rather than in retirement communities or senior independent living facilities. In these circumstances you should be conscious and take some measurement to ensure your family member feels safe and independent in their home.Communication is crucial in the modern age in which we live. Making sure seniors have access to important phone numbers, websites and emails for doctors, nurses, friends and family is even more crucial. This is because technology changes rapidly and it’s sometimes difficult to keep up. Smartphones, tablets, and computers are great ways to stay in touch via text, email, video or voice calling and they have the added benefit of bringing access to e-books, play games, listen to music as well as keep tracking of important dates and appointments. Moving into a new senior independent living facility also might pose the challenge of needing to either downsize the amount of furniture or get new furniture for an individual. Trying to cram all the furniture from a 1,600 square foot house into an 800 square foot apartment would be a nightmare. Minimizing the amount of furniture might have the added benefit when in a senior independent living facility to make it easier to move around and reduce the time it takes care providers to finish their services. Emergency response systems and home security systems should be installed in and around the home. These systems are programmed in a way that they instantly communicate with a 24/7 available security center in the event of accident, robbery and other mishaps, within a single push of a button. These centers also offer medical devices with full detection functionality along with health inspection and instant GPS tracking software, which can provide some extra independence and a feeling of wellbeing to the <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/to-live-alone-or-with-family-members/"">family</a>.

4936,"Millennial Consumer Behavior: Understanding Millennials","Millennials are the largest consumer demographic in the United States today, including approximately 77 million individuals. Making up nearly a quarter of the population, it is important to understand millennial consumer behavior and millennial consumer trends. It is vital to understand these behaviors and trends for any business to survive and thrive. Fortunately, once this information is obtained, companies can develop specific millennial marketing plans and strategies to help grow their businesses. By looking at research studies we can observe and note that millennial consumers are very different from previous generations.
<h3>Getting to Know More about Millennial Consumer Behavior</h3>
Common <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2018/05/03/for-small-business-week-all-about-millennial-consumers-and-millennial-friendly-customer-experiences/"">millennial consumer behaviors</a> result from the time frame in which they were born, coupled with major global events at that time. This unique combination is different from other generations because of how easily accessible information became with the advancement of technology. It is with this constant stream of up to date information, from a large variety of sources, many millennials' worldviews have been negatively affected. Millennials do not have specific dates of when they were born, but most agree that they were born somewhere between 1980 and 2000. Many people make the assumption that anyone born after 1980 is a millennial, but that is not necessarily the case. Technically, anyone born after 2000 would be part of Generation Z. “Millennial” is not a blanket term for young people and exclusively accounts for the people born in that time frame from 1980 to 2000.

It’s not surprising to know, that the massive increase of new technology and the advancement of the internet has provided Millennials with a unique global viewpoint, quite different than that other generations. As new technology grows essential to the lifestyle of this generation, millennials are more reliant on technology than any of the previous generations. Many would agree that millennials always have their face in their cell phones because of their increased social media use.

Millennials are currently the most educated generation. This increased time spent in the classroom has a direct impact on millennial consumer behavior and heavily impacts millennial consumer trends. As more of the baby boomer workforce retire, more and more of these ambitious and well-educated millennials are taking up managerial positions. These changes allow millennials to step into jobs that provide better financially, opening up opportunities once considered out-of-reach.

The millennial generation includes some of the most well-connected people on the planet. The widespread use of smartphones provides millennials with a mobile platform to shop, communicate, and find information in seconds. Millennial consumer behavior shows that millennials, like older generations, prefer brick and mortar storefronts over online shopping. Shoppers have stated that, “You want to touch it, you want to smell it; you want to pick it up.” This is used in conjunction with online shopping in a term called “Showrooming”. Showrooming is where you examine goods in a retail store and then look for the desired item online to find the best deal, sometimes ordering from the stores own website, which often offers cheaper prices and discounts. These shipping techniques are made even easier with the abundance of smartphone technology, so anyone can search the internet while in the store itself. Millennials have a lot of buying power thanks to these changes; they spend $600 million shopping each year in America and are expected to have a total worldwide spending power of over 3.39 trillion in 2018. With this in mind, companies are hard pressed to make millennial marketing strategies that work.

During their lives, millennials also have seen many unfortunate events occurring in the world; the attacks on 9/11, the Great Recession, the housing market crash, also the war on terror and other global conflicts. Millennials are therefore more pragmatic overall, and sometimes have a pessimistic view of the world. Negative stereotypes state that millennials are spoiled and want praise for the most insignificant accomplishments. This is not the case, as these are just stereotypes from older generations. Many forget that millennials were the children being given these participation awards although they never asked for them and these awards are just one example of the many misconceptions about the millennial generation.

Most millennials are very hard-working and diligent and try to find new and innovative ways to solve problems. Because they were raised to practice group participation, they listen and share ideas better and faster than other generations. Millennials also use these skills to solve problems more easily.

Unfortunately, the combination of the recession and increases in college tuition forced many millennials graduating from high school and college to accept jobs with a lower rate of pay, if they could even find a job at all. This caused many of these millennials to take jobs they were overqualified for and the financial consequences forced many to move back to their childhood homes as a result. The increase in housing and school costs has continued to increase drastically in the last 30 years while the wages have not kept up. These specific economic challenges have had a big impact on millennial consumer behavior and millennial consumer trends.
<h3>Why it’s Important to Understand Millennial Consumer Trends</h3>
As stated before, the differences between previous generations and millennial consumer behavior stem from the negative views held by many millennials. This view has caused many millennials to place more value on experiences rather than objects, or on things that make them feel better about themselves than just the item itself.

Millennial consumer trends show that half of millennials will spend their money on experiences over material things. A great move for millennial marketing, which many companies are already capitalizing on, is to try experimental marketing strategies. Some such strategies allow millennials to physically interact with brands and other consumers at special sponsored events. Other companies are sponsoring event meetups in cities and even in virtual reality, where millennials are more than happy to pay to try some new and unique experiences.

Surveys show that 60% of millennials prefer to make purchases that they feel are ways to express their personalities. If a brand can speak to a millennial on this level, then it can create a connection with that consumer. Forming a connection will make millennials feel better about making purchases from that brand more easily. Millennial consumer behavior shows that they value their money and products more if and when they meet both an emotional need and also make logistical sense. This differs from the views of baby boomers and Gen Xers, who buy based more on quantifiable needs. Companies like Tom’s Shoes have mastered this with their “buy one, give one” marketing promotions, in which for every pair of shoes purchased they donate a pair of shoes to people in need. Millennials feel it is important to make the consumer feel good about their choices when making their purchases, while also helping others at the same time. All millennial marketing strategies can and should take into account the consumer’s feelings when making a purchase to maximize their effectiveness.

While looking at millennial marketing, companies need to be aware of how <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/staying-socially-connected/"">millennials are using social media</a>. Millennials are 13% more likely to share purchases on social media then Gen Xers are. This millennial consumer trend works in much the same way as a product review, allowing others to hear opinions and experiences both good and bad. With this in mind, companies need to actively engage with consumers on social media and list to what is being said and address any issues that may be brought up.

Technology changes more and more every day, and we are seeing advancements in computers, cell phones and other smart devices every few months. It is important to realize that these new technologies are going to be used by millennials and are targeted towards them. When devising a <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/generational-marketing-strategy-in-2018/"">millennial marketing strategy</a>, it must be understood that much of this technology will be bringing new trends with them to market. An example of one such trend is that many modern-day devices already use voice assistant technology. It is strongly believed that we will be able to interact with just body language, intonation, touch or just gestures like we do with people in newer smart devices. These new interactive features could be implemented in as little as 3 years. Many smart devices already adopted these features, from smart fridges and microwaves to, smart home security systems. Soon we may be able to have the doors lock and unlock automatically, turn alarm systems off and on using just from a wave of the hand.

According to Forbes, an important millennial marketing point is that millennials prefer ads and social media posts that are relevant to them. It is important for brands and companies to remember that millennials strive for this relevance and personalization in their products. A company needs to incorporate research on how their brand connects with its target market as part of any millennial marketing strategy. To that end, over one-third of millennials will wait to try a product or service until it is used by someone they trust has tried it first. Millennial consumer behavior relies heavily on word of mouth and many ignore corporate recommendations that are not targeting them individually. This makes it an integral in any millennial marketing strategy to incorporate practices that can help build trust amongst its consumers. This can be done by realizing critical millennial consumer behavior, keeping in mind that millennials love trying new and innovative brands. Don’t view a millennial marketing strategy as a way to win customers from your competitors, instead you must think about how to meet a customer’s needs, continue to concentrate on connecting with your customers and giving them a reason to come back. Brand loyalty amongst millennials is relatively low, therefore building trust and making a connection is the best way to make a happy more loyal customer.

It’s proven that millennials expect more from their companies and brands than older generations. They want companies to treat both their employees and their customers well. A 2017 study shows that one third of consumers buy brands based on their social and environmental impact. This belief in a company’s responsibilities to the planet, its employees, and its customers, is a newer expectation that is an important one for millennials. It is important for a company to maintain an open dialog with its customers and employees, while showing a willingness to cater to the needs and desires of them.

5004,"Tips From Leading Millennial Generation Experts","Millennial is a term that gets used a lot lately. It's generally either tossed around as an insult and a slur, or as a badge of pride for those that identify as one. But what is a millennial really? How can businesses get the most out of their millennial employees? Today we’re going to talk about the different generations and learn how millennial speakers, millennial generation experts, and millennial motivational speakers can help your business.
<h3>Knowing the Generational Differences</h3>
Let’s start with learning about the 3 largest generations that make up most of the job market today: Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, and Millennials.
<h4>Baby Boomer 1946-1964</h4>
Baby Boomers were born between 1946 and 1964, and they were the first generation that was truly observed and regularly documented. Baby boomers were born to parents during the post-World War II success and they grew up watching many new industries and an expanded housing market form, as well as the start of the Cold War. Boomers were raised with the ideals of the “Nuclear Family” and they faced many social issues such as the civil rights movement, and watching armed conflicts taking place like the Korean and Vietnam wars.  Baby boomers have been in control of the government and most of the business world for decades and hold places of power and management in a substantial number of organizations. Under baby boomer leadership, many companies have had to weather extreme hardships, including the 2008 recession. The most successful companies have adapted to the turmoil and have set up financial training programs that they feel will be helpful for current and future and employees.

In the workplace boomer leaders have been routinely accused of not understanding or connecting effectively with younger generations. Baby boomers tend to prefer more traditional training methods like classes, seminars, and workshops. These teaching methods are still used regularly, but much of the millennial workforce prefer either a more hands-on or a more computer-based learning approach so that they can practice the skills they are being taught in <em>real time</em>. One of the most important insights for a baby boomer to understand when dealing with the younger generations is that their cohort is made up of the most educated and technologically savvy workforce in history. These employees are willing to work hard and to learn, but expect to be given clearly defined goals to maximize their effectiveness. Millennial generation experts and millennial speakers can be a crucial asset in helping companies maintain a strong and engaged intergenerational workforce.
<h4>Generation X 1964-1980</h4>
Generation X has been called the “Lost Generation” or the ""Latch-Key"" generation. This is due to that fact that this cohort had less adult supervision compared to previous groups. With more and more women entering the workforce, and with the increase of higher divorce rates during this timeframe Generation X was largely left to fend for themselves. Gen Xers tend to more often hold middle management positions if they work for an organization, but <em>many</em> are entrepreneurs and owners of small businesses. In fact, in 2017 over 60% of all new businesses were started by Gen Xer’s. Epitomizing the “work hard/play hard” mentality, members of the Gen X group are known for putting their heads down and working diligently to get what they want. Generation X is considered more adept at using new technology compared to Baby Boomers, and this understanding of technology has also earned many the title of <em>nerds</em>. In fact, some of the most prominent and influential websites like YouTube, Amazon and Google, were created by Gen Xer’s. Generation Xer's characteristic of creativity doesn’t just stop at websites - many popular Authors, Actors, Artist, Scientists, and Fashion Designers are also a part of this group.

In addition, the left brain output of this generation has brought many great moments of entertainment and a new understanding of how the world works from a global standpoint. Considered naturally committed workers who are well educated and very self-reliant, Gen Xers tend to need less hand-holding when it comes to training as compared to their millennial counterparts. Generation X is smaller than both the baby boomers and the millennials but they still make up a large percentage of the workforce.
<h4>Millennials 1980-2000</h4>
Millennials, also know as Generation Y,  are most frequently referred to as having been born between 1980 and 2000 (although there is some debate as to the exact range of their birth years). The media tends to generalize this group by making blanket claims about the laziness and sense of entitlement that millennials portray, constantly saying that they are unmotivated and self centered. Millennials have also been called brand and industry killers. Millennial generation experts will say that many millennials simply can’t afford to spend money on brand names and that they would rather spend their hard-earned wages on something that makes them feel better about their health and well being (<em>hence the famed millennial endorsed avocado toast!</em>).

Millennials have been heavily exposed to the 24 hour news cycle and overall are considered the most highly educated generation of workers. They use technology with ease and they are seen as a solution oriented group. They often attempt to evaluate policies, come up with disruptive ways of completing tasks and seem comfortable thinking on a global scale. Having grown up surrounded by advanced technology - they were the 1st generation of digital natives - they've developed different viewpoints compared to older generations. Millennial generation experts claim that millennials feel they are forced to try to fix issues created by older generations. In contrast, they claim that older generations often don’t understand just how much the world has changed and the speed/rate of the change that has occurred. For example, as of 2014, college tuition and fees have increased by 1,120%, compared to 1978. The price of food has increased 244% and medical expenses 601% during that same time frame. Bloomberg reports that tuition prices have gone up four times faster than the consumer price index. This has all been happening while wages have nearly stagnated for the same amount of time - thus presenting a financial quagmire that millennials find themselves trying to dig out of in an effort to have financial stability.

Millennial speakers will often say that the older generations are stubborn and have settled into a rut after decades of working. Baby boomers tend to denounce the reality many millennials are forced to endure just to earn enough to afford basic amenities. Due to the lower wages offered by many companies, most millennials that are lucky enough to find work are working multiple jobs. Others are stuck working at jobs they are overqualified for just to try and pay off the debt that was accumulated to get degrees that were considered to be a “mandatory” requirement when they were starting their undergraduate and graduate studies. A common millennial motivational speaker topic is the “Schrodinger’s Millennial” paradox which states; <em>you need money to get a degree, a job to get money, experience to get a job, but you can’t get experience without a degree</em>. This cycle is one that members of this cohort are all too familiar with and helps explains why many millennials feel frustrated and are anxious about what their future holds. Millennial generation experts will often tell you that members of this cohort are pragmatic but pessimistic, the sense of pessimism tends to come from their world view. Growing up with the ability to access information 24/7 - from almost any geographic location - has allowed them to see events unfold in real time. This has made millennials want to help and connect with others more - although most often virtually.

Companies should keep in mind that millennials have a ton of buying power, spending $600 million shopping each year in the United States alone, globally they are expected to command a spending power of over $3.4 trillion by the end of 2018. Studies show that half of millennials will spend their discretionary funds on experiences over material items and they are more than happy to pay a premium for these activities. Surveys show that 60% of millennials prefer to make a purchase if those purchases will allow them to express their ""unique personalities"" (not sure what that means exactly! ?‍♀️). Millennial consumers value their money and are more likely to purchase a product if they meet both an emotional need and make logistical sense. To that effect, companies will need to gain a deeper knowledge base about this cohort be able to create effective segmented marketing messaging that will capture this burgeoning consumer. Millennial generation experts, millennial speakers, and millennial motivational speakers can provide those educational tools to organizations in need. Learning to properly reach the 80M millennials is going to be crucial for many businesses to succeed, organizations would be smart to start that process by listening to their own millennial employees for feedback and ideas.

In addition to the financial items we've already discussed it's important for employers to remember that your millennial employees <em>(and consumers</em>) care about giving back. Using this knowledge is now an essential part of business as more of this population segment begins to join the workforce. If your company doesn't have a set of rituals (e.g., making employees feel hear/valued and a commitment to changing the world or changing the sector in which you operate) you can be sure that your millennial employees won’t be as committed to their jobs as you would like them to be going forward. Millennial insist that they want to work for a company that wants to better them, better the world, and better the economy.
<h3>What can millennial generation experts can teach you?</h3>
Now that we’ve learned a little something about some of the differences between our 3 largest generations let's look at some examples of what millennial generation experts and millennial speakers can teach you and your employees. Below are a few topics that experts can discuss - through a millennial lens - when brought in to lecture and consult with businesses.
<ul>
 	<li>Optimal tactics for leading change and driving innovation</li>
 	<li>Solving the worlds' ""big problems"" through communication</li>
 	<li>Innovative approaches to brand-building and corporate entrepreneurship</li>
 	<li>Future trends and impending disruptions within technology that impact business and politics.</li>
 	<li>Applications of technology and social media in business</li>
 	<li>Tools for embedding technology to strengthen client connections without losing that personal touch</li>
 	<li>Political and social commentary and analysis elucidating where your company fits in</li>
 	<li>The impact of technology on incumbent industries and how to take advantage of new media to stay relevant and get ahead of your competition</li>
</ul>
A few additional tips: Keep in mind that while Millennials are younger then Gen Xers and baby boomers, they see themselves as hardworking professional adults who will one day be societal change agents. Don’t make them feel like they are ""nothing more than a bunch of teenagers"" - trust me if you do so you will come to regret dismissing them as their generation is known to reciprocate loyalty. Also, try not to use the word millennial as an insult and please don’t get lazy and just group them together with Generation Z as one ""under 40"" segment, these generations have vastly different viewpoints and goals.

Lastly, invest in your millennial employees. Give them options for continued learning or greater immersion into key communities and spaces. Make sure that they are getting professional development budgets. By investing in your staff, you'll see stronger results from them. <em>Ask yourself:</em> Are we asking our millennial employees (frankly all employees...) what they want from their employer, or what matters to them? Talk to your workers, and involve them in meetings and conversations - trust me you'll be amazed at the new ideas and suggestions that you will receive in return. Millennials care about their work and take it seriously, so it's only right that their company should do the same.

5611,"Traditionalist Generation: Generational Marketing Part 1","<h3>The Traditionalist Generation: Using Generational Marketing to understand who they are, and how to market to them.</h3>
<h3>What is Generational Marketing?</h3>
When considering the Traditionalist Generation in your marketing strategies, it is import to first have a basic understanding of the concept of generational marketing.  Generational marketing is a common-sense approach to refining marketing strategies to target the unique values and priorities of the five generations living and working side-by-side in today’s society. The catalyst for this nuance in marketing strategies came about when marketing experts realized that they were marketing to five very distinct generations. Each of these generations had distinctive characteristics and often different goals, values, and motivations. Once marketing experts were aware of these generational differences, they realized that they could, and should, adjust their strategies to match the values and motivations of each generation.
<h3>Understanding Generations</h3>
A generation is defined as a cohort of individuals born around the same time. Because of when they were born and the influence of the culture of their times, each generation has unique experiences that shape their values and their paradigm for how they view the world and their place in that world. Most experts agree that there are a total of five generations currently in the workforce. They are:
<ul>
 	<li>The Traditionalists – born before 1945.</li>
 	<li>Baby Boomers – born 1946 to 1964.</li>
 	<li>Generation X – born 1965 to 1980.</li>
 	<li>Generation Y or Millennials – born 1981 to 1995.</li>
 	<li>Generation Z – born 1996 to 2012.</li>
</ul>
Perhaps you have heard some of these terms before, terms such as Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials. These phrases have entered the popular vocabulary, but few understand the differences between these generations or the challenges and opportunities that come from these populations living and working side by side. Even fewer have grasped the importance of the opportunities that come with studying and understanding how each generation thinks, to better serve their needs and market goods and services tailored to those needs.
<h3>Traditionalist Generation: Who Are They?</h3>
This article will focus on understanding the elder statesmen in our economy today. This generation is often called the Traditionalist or Traditional Generation. They are sometimes called the <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/the-silent-generation-characteristics-and-facts-you-need-to-know/"">Silent Generation</a> as well. This is the group that was born before 1945. It is often useful to have these rough distinctions to help conceptualize generational distinctions, but the dates are more of a convenience than an immovable deadline. The Traditionalist Generation ends at roughly 1945 because that marks the end of World War II and the beginning of the Baby Boomer generation, which is most often references as being from 1946 to 1963.
<h3>What are the characteristics of the Traditionalist?</h3>
Those born into the Traditionalist Generation had parents who may have fought in World War I or World War II and also survived the Great Depression. The Traditionalists themselves were probably too young to fight in World War II and entered the workforce during the post-war economic boom. They also lived through the Korean War and McCarthyism and the Red Scare. Because they are conforming and civic-minded, a famous article in Time magazine in November of 1951 bequeathed on this generation another moniker: “<a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/the-silent-generation-characteristics-and-facts-you-need-to-know/"">The Silent Generation</a>”.

The children in the Traditionalist Generation grew up with parents still reeling from World Wars and the Great Depression and gifted their children with a strong work ethic and an appreciation of having a steady job. The Traditionalists were and are the smallest generation in our workforce today. In part, this is due to the low birthrate in the United States in the ’30s and ’40s. Even with their small numbers, their conservative view on life, their work ethic and their strong desire to invest help create a secure future for their families, they are considered the wealthiest generation of the five in our workforce today.

The Traditionalists as a group are amazing people. In the 75+ years, they have been alive, they have probably seen more change any other generation in human history. They have gone from paper and pencil to cloud computing. In their lifetime they transitioned from listening to radio dramas for entertainment to watching YouTube, Netflix and streaming content. When they were young, they would keep in touch with friends and family by visiting in person, the occasional phone calls or writing a letter. Now, there are many other communication options such as email, voice mail, instant messaging, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, FaceTime, Skype and other means to communicate with anyone in the world, instantly. If they pursued higher education, they went to a university, went to a classroom on campus, listened to the lecture, and went home and read the textbook and studied for the test. Now we have online textbooks, distance learning, and virtual classrooms. All of these changes have positively and negatively impacted our world and all of the generations currently still in the workforce. The impact of the changes from generation to generation needs to be defined and studied. Those findings can help marketers target their message for each generation of consumers.
<h3>Things to consider when marketing to the Traditionalist Generation</h3>
The Traditionalists are tending to work longer and retire later than people just a few decades prior. Those in the Traditionalists Generation are retiring later because good medical care has allowed people to live longer, social security is not the safety net it used to be, and they are choosing to work longer because of their work ethic. Because loyalty is one of their defining characteristics, they are probably are still working for the same company they have worked for decades.

The roots of their past run deep. Having been schooled in thriftiness from their parents who lived through World Wars and the Great Depression, the Traditionalist Generation members tend to be cautious with their money. For example, because of their thriftiness, they may take care of their cars and keep them for a long time. If someone had the job of marketing lease vehicles to someone in the Traditionalist Generation, they would have their work cut out for them.

Marketing a car to the Traditionalist Generation may be a challenge, but not an impossible one. As one can imagine, many members of the Traditionalist Generation struggle with understanding and using new technology. If a marketer was trying to convince them to lease a car by discussing the cutting-edge Bluetooth connectivity capabilities of the car, that approach would probably not connect with the Traditionalist. However, family, safety, security, and predictability are all high on their priority list, especially protection and security for their family. To market a leased car to the Traditionalist Generation, a marketer would be wise to emphasize any characteristics of the lease that are in line with these values. Perhaps Bluetooth technology would not convince them to lease, but an emphasis put on the technology that helps avoid collisions and keep a car in its own lane may be a more persuasive selling point.

Having grown up watching their parents struggle to put food on the table and keep their jobs, members of the Traditionalist Generation do not lean toward luxury for luxuries sake. They tend to avoid waste and prefer simplicity and reliability to complexity. They would not do well with a high-pressure sales pitch and tactics that refer to “limited time offers” or “Order before midnight tonight!” Marketing campaigns that do not pressure, but praise the wisdom of going slowly and carefully, gathering information and considering all of the facts before making a decision would be much more in line with the values of members in the Traditionalist Generation.

Because of the lack of technological ease shared by many in this generation, email blasts or social media ads may not be the best way to reach out to the Traditionalists. Members of this generation report that direct mailings are actually their most preferred method of being exposed to adds and special offers. This makes sense, considering the fact that they grew up with print media like newspapers and books. Marketers may also want to consider such avenues as print ads or radio commercials. These platforms should be viewed as an important component of any effective marketing campaign. It would be wise to not totally count out any social media however. It is reported that just as many members of the Traditionalist Generation have computers as the Baby Boomers or Millennials. According to data from the Pew Research Center in 2014, 59% of adults 65 years old or older use the internet, and fully 88% of adults over 65 use email. The number of older adults online is continually growing. Many are using social media, especially Facebook, to stay connected and to search for friends and family. Other social media options, such as Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat are not widely used by this generation.

Another avenue is television adds. Seniors view the most television in a week, with over 51 hours per week being the average in 2015. Having television adds for your products would be well-received by members of the Traditionalist Generation.

While the Traditionalist Generation may not be as tech-savvy as later generations, they do tend to have impeccable interpersonal skills. Marketers should consider that face-to-face communication may be the most effective way of marketing to the members of the 75 and older demographic. One note of caution however. This generation respects authority figures, and was raised with a strong ethic that “your word is your bond”. It is imperative to keep your word, follow through on your promises, and deliver on all of the benefits of your goods or services that you have discussed.
When talking to them, they will respond well when they are shown respect for their age and experience. The wise marketer may consider being a bit formal, introducing themselves and addressing the Traditionalist properly with a Mr. or Mrs. when speaking to them. Along the same lines, if the marketing is geared toward a big-ticket item, following up with a hand-written known is a more recommended way to follow up, much preferred to a more informal and impersonal email or text message.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In conclusion, the Traditionalist, or Silent Generation have lived a long time and have seen many changes in their lifetimes. They have witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of wars, and have felt the thrill of mankind’s advances, such as Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. They have strongly held values that are not going to change. They are conservative, hard-working, and family-oriented. They are loyal to a fault, and if a company can win them over, they will be loyal customers for a long time.
Knowing how the Traditionalist Generation is different from the Baby Boomers,

Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation Z, can greatly assist the savvy marketer to tailor their campaigns to each generation for the greatest effect.

5617,"Marketing to Millennials: Generational Marketing Part 2","Marketing to Millennials is a challenge often faced by businesses and product creators of the 21st century. In this article, we will explore some of the challenges and things to consider when marketing to Millennials. The concept of generational marketing involves understanding the unique needs, motivations and values of each of the five generations currently in the workforce, and tailoring marketing to meet those needs. To target the Millennial Generation, first we have to know: Who are the Millennials?
<h3>Who are the Millennials?</h3>
There are many questions that may arise when talking about Millennials. What are the millennial years? Is a Millennial the same as Generation X? Generation Y? Generation Z? What is the difference between a Millennial and a Baby Boomer? First of all, all generations are defined by a range of years in which they were born. Baby Boomers are roughly from the end of World War II (1945) to the early 1960’s. After the Baby Boomers is Generation X, or Gen X, which is the name given to the generation born from around 1961 to 1980. Then come the Millennials! To clear up any confusion, Millennials are also known as Generation Y, or Gen Y. Why? Because “Y” is after “X”, that’s all! The Millennial years often refer to those individuals born between the years 1982 to 2004. The dates are imprecise, so it may be useful to think of the early 1980’s as the years Millennials began to be born, to end of the 1990s and early 2000s as the ending of the birth years for the Millennial Generation.

According to the U.S. Census, this span of about 20 years has a population of about 76 million. This is a huge population with enormous potential spending power that marketers need to fully understand to be able to tap that potential. That’s where the concept of Generational Marketing becomes vital.
<h3>Generational Marketing and Neuroscience</h3>
When facing the challenge of marketing to millennials, or any specific generation for that matter, it is helpful to have some basic understanding of the neuroscience behind generational marketing. The concept that people born in different generations would have different values, want different products and have different motivations just makes sense. Someone born in 1940 would probably feel differently about social media platforms like blogs, Snapchat, Twitter and YouTube than someone born in the year 2000. A concept that helps explain why there are preferences in each generation have to do with a concept in neuroscience called neuro-plasticity. That term means that our brains are malleable, like plastic, and change as a result of interaction with the environment. When considering tailoring a marketing campaign through the lens of generational marketing, it is wise to ruminate on just how many changes have occurred in society in the last 50 or 60 years, and consider how that could impact how the brains in each of those generations were affected.

A quick comparison of the changes in the worlds of Generation X, born in the 1960s and 1970s, and Generation Y, or Millennials, illuminates some of the staggering differences between these two generations. When Generation X was beginning, there was no internet, no handheld calculators, no social media, no YouTube, no streaming content, no videotapes, DVDs or CDs. No cable tv, no microwave ovens. No man on the moon, no space shuttle or Falcon Heavy spacecraft. Their parents were just coming off the Korean War, and the conflict in a little-known place called Vietnam was just heating up. If you were to ask them what the capital of the State of Michigan was, if they didn’t already have that fact memorized, they would start thinking about the name of the reference book in which they could find that information.

Millennials, born in the 1980s and 1990s and early 2000s, never knew a world without the internet. They have come of age with the I phone, social media, YouTube and e-commerce sites like Amazon. In their short lifespans, media has evolved from broadcast television to video to DVD to streaming media. They watch YouTube on their phones and talk to their television sets. If someone asked a Millennial what the capital of the State of Michigan was, they would reach for their phone and ask Siri, or Cortana, or Alexa, or Google the question, or think about a website where the information may be stored and accessed by them.

These are tremendous changes in the environment in practically every aspect of life. When there are changes in the environment, due to the human brain’s capacity for change thanks to neuroplasticity, the brains of Millennials are wired very differently from the brains of <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/15-facts-you-need-to-know-about-baby-boomers/"">Baby Boomers</a> or Generation X. Next, let’s look at some of the characteristics of the Millennial Generation, and how to best market to meet those needs, including their love of online exploration and interacting with the online community, and their preference for being able to use a product or service when they need it, rather than own something outright.
<h3>Marketing to Millennials: Importance of the internet</h3>
Perhaps the most important thing to consider when marketing to Millennials is the internet. The internet, and constant access to the internet anytime, anywhere, has become an integral part of the life of the Millennial. Millennials are spending an average of 25 hours per week online. They are plugged in and online constantly. They enjoy interacting with the online community as well. This interaction can be accomplished in numerous ways, such as creating tweeting and forwarding tweets, or commenting on everything from restaurants and hotel accommodations to YouTube videos and on the performance and price of products they have purchased.
<h3>The Millennial Generation enjoy online exploration</h3>
Due to the influence of the internet, traditional, outbound marketing such as magazine ads, direct mail, and radio spot simply do not connect with Millennials. To the Millennials, these marketing strategies may feel impersonal, and do not give them any chance to interact with the company, product or service. When marketing to Millennials the interaction of the online experience is essential.

The Millennial consumer actually enjoys looking for a product or service online. They do not usually buy on impulse. They relish the challenge of finding the best product or service at the best price, and have a good time doing the research. How is this research accomplished? As mentioned earlier, Millennials enjoy commenting and reviewing the products and services they have used or purchased. Millennials comment on their experience using these products or services. They comment, and other members of the online community read and are influenced. Millennial consumers read reviews. According to one recent study, a whopping 84% said that user-generated content has at least some influence on what they buy. They also listen to experts online, whether the experts are online bloggers or YouTube Channel stars, their opinion matters to the Millennial consumer. This is due in part because they speak the language of the Millennial. The YouTubers speak like and use the vocabulary of their Millennial peers. They also listen because much of the content the Millennial finds online is informational and interactive.

Because of their penchant for online research, the wise entrepreneur will make sure their website appearance is up to date and has a contemporary look. 92% of Millennials have reported that the look and appearance on a website could influence their experience, including being a factor in them deciding whether or not to give their personal information on a website. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to have creative and appealing landing pages. Having less text and more imaging can help in creating an engaging experience for web surfers.
<h3>Marketing to Millennials:  the role of social media</h3>
Because Millennials like to research, read reviews and listen to experts, marketers should seriously consider the content and style of their social media presence on the internet. When marketing to Millennials, keep in mind that this is a generation hungry for content. They crave product information and get a thrill out of finding the best price. Marketers need to aggressively publish informative content via blog posts, product reviews, YouTube videos, white papers and other ways that get out information about that product that is fun, informative and will help the Millennial decide on their product or service. Millennials are 54% more likely to purchase goods or services that are recommended by what is known as a social media influencer, such as a YouTube or Instagram star. Many of the influencers on social media make millions of dollars a year, and have become a force to be reckoned with in the marketing world.

Millennials also enjoy helping to feel as if they are part of the creative process. 42 percent of Millennials have reported that they are interested in being involved with the creation and development of products and services in the future. How can this be accomplished? Start looking around and numerous examples will start become obvious. One recent example was the potato chip company that famously had a contest to have the consumer decide the next flavor of their next potato chip flavors.
In terms of social media platforms, Facebook is still the largest and most used, but YouTube and Instagram are gaining ground in terms of use by younger generations.
<h3>The Millennial Generation prefer use over ownership</h3>
Another interesting characteristic of the Millennial years is that many of them prefer using a product and being able to access it when they need it, rather than owning the product outright. A 2014 report found that fully 35% of the group survey reported that their preference would be to pay for a product or service, even at full price, to have access to the product or service when they needed it, instead of ownership.

There are numerous examples of this already in existence. Millennials are apt to lease a more luxurious car than they could afford to purchase. The explosive growth of Uber and Lyft for short-term car leasing and Air BnB and Home Away as an alternative to hotels also supports this trend.

The Millennial Generation, or Gen Y, has seen much change in their short lifetimes. Some say that the Millennials have seen more change than just about any other generation in history. In terms of technological changes, that very well may be true. In was in January of 2007, only 12 short years ago, when Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, introduced the iPhone to the world The video can still be viewed on YouTube. When Jobs showed the audience how the iPhone has the capability of scrolling through addresses with a flick of the finger, the audience can be heard audibly gasping. When he projected a picture that was on his iPhone to a screen, and used his fingers to zoom in and out of the picture, the audience spontaneously burst into applause. That was just a little over a decade ago. What used to be magic is now commonplace. Facebook started in 2004, YouTube in 2005. In just a few short years, platforms that were unthinkable to the generation before are now commonplace and being used in ways that could not have been predicted. It is the exciting task of the modern business person to embrace these changes when marketing to Millennials, understand how this generation uses and relies on these for their information and entertainment, and how they can change their <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/generational-marketing-strategy-in-2018/"">marketing campaigns</a> to accommodate the online world of the Millennial Generation.",,"2020-08-09 18:45:56",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/marketing-to-millennials-gen-marketing-2/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Marketing-to-Millennials.jpg,"Marketing to Millennials",,,"Marketing to Millennials",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Marketing-to-Millennials.jpg,,Longevity,"generation myth","1990s and early 2000s|capital of the state|changes in the environment|concept of generational marketing|generation|generation x|generation y|generational marketing|interacting with the online|interacting with the online community|marketing|marketing to millennials|millennial|millennial generation|millennials|online|product|product or service|social media|social media platforms",,,,,,,87,,,"marketing to millennials","Marketing to Millennials -Who are Millennials - Generational Marketing","Marketing to Millennials is a challenge often faced by businesses and product creators who are born in 21st century.

5695,"Marketing to Baby Boomers in 2019 - 3 things to consider","Marketing to Baby Boomers in 2019 is essential to any comprehensive marketing plan. The wise marketing plan should consider the Baby Boomer Generation for several reasons which we will cover in this article, as well as specific strategies for appealing to this affluent, powerful generation. First, let’s start by learning more about the Baby Boomers generation.
<h3>Marketing to Baby Boomers, by the numbers</h3>
When marketing to Baby Boomers, it is essential to first understand and who these consumers are. Generally speaking, the Baby boomer generation are said to be those born between the years 1946 and 1964. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were an estimated 76 million Americans born during the Baby Boomer era. Many of them are now retired, or currently in their peak earning years. A recent report by the World Bank’s Consumer Expenditure Survey found that in 2013, Baby Boomers spent $3.2 trillion annually in the United States. For comparison, that number is larger than the total Gross National Product of many countries, including Russia and France. It is clear that there a lot of Boomers, they have money, and they are spending that money.

A generation in broad terms usually refers to a span of about thirty years. The Baby Boomers have a somewhat unusual, very distinct beginning to their generation: the end of World War II. The United States was devastated after World War II, and people were ready to get back to a normal life. That attitude, along with the G.I. bill that was passed by the United States Congress after World War II helped by making loans available to veterans at very low or even no interest. This encouraged home ownership and enabled many to get a higher education. So now the returning veterans had a home, an education and a job. It was time to start making babies! And boy did they make a lot of them. In the first year of the Baby Boom, 1946, there were 3.4 million recorded births. The birth rate peaked in 1957, when the Census Bureau reported 4.3 million babies born, which stands to this day as the highest number of births ever recorded in a single year in the United States.

<h3>Interesting Facts about the Baby Boomer Generation</h3>
With the Boomer Generation being so large, there are bound to be some interesting trivia about them! For example, it is interesting to note that 52% of boomers are female. Also, while the youngest of the Boomers will turn 65 in 2029, the oldest of the Baby Boomers, started turning 65 in 2011, and according to AARP, 10,000 Boomers a DAY have been turning 65 every since!

Another interesting fact about the Baby Boomers is that, in part thanks to the loans available from the G.I. bill, the boomers are highly educated, with over half having at least some college experience. If you love trivia, here are two facts for you. The last four presidents of the United States are Baby Boomers, with Barack Obama being born in 1961 and here’s something I’ll bet you didn’t know: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Donald Trump all being born in the same year: 1946!
<h3>Was the Baby Boom just in the United States?</h3>
When most consider their strategy for marketing to Baby Boomers, they think about U.S. <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/boomer-consumer-size-and-market-potential/"">consumers</a>, but this generational phenomena is broader than one might expect.  With the world economy so interdependent and with the advent of the game-changing importance of the Worldwide Web and e-commerce, it is crucial that any business looks at their potential market with a broader vision. The e-commerce market is not just state-wide or country-wide. The customer base for any business with a website is potentially anyone in the world. Therefore, when considering targeted marketing, it is also important to know that the Baby Boom was not just in the United States! Every country involved in World War II had a surge of population after the war, starting around 1946. The Baby Boomer Generation, while known by other names, is truly a worldwide phenomenon. For example, in the United Kingdom, the surge of babies being born after World War II is known as “The Bulge”. In Japan, the surge in babies being born after the War is known as “Dankai no sedai” which means The Generation of Nodule.

So, we know that there was a huge surge of population after World War II. We also know now that this increase in births was a phenomenon that occurred throughout the world in the decades after World War II. There are a few other things we need to know about the Baby Boomer Generation to understand how to market to them.
<h3>Baby Boomers and Technology</h3>
The last of the Boomers graduated high school in the early 80’s. This was a time way before many of the technological advances that are commonplace today, but would have seemed impossible even a few decades ago. These innovations include the World Wide Web, social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Snap Chat. Technology including I-Phones, streaming video and even websites. How did we even make it back then without all of this? Even though this technology was not available, this does not mean that the Boomers are not tech-savvy. As a matter of fact, the Baby Boomers are online in record numbers. That doesn’t necessarily mean they are up on all of the latest apps and social media platforms, but they are online. Google conducted a study in 2013 and found that 78% of Baby Boomers were regularly online. A third of the Boomers described themselves as “heavy internet users”, and actually spend more online that the generation after them, the <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/marketing-to-millennials-gen-marketing-2/"">Millennial</a> Generation, or Gen Y. 80% of boomers are on at least one social media platform.
<h3>Three things to consider when marketing to Baby Boomers</h3>
We know a lot about the Baby Boomer Generation. We know that there are many of them, they are online a lot, but may not have the latest trendy social media platform. We know that their roots are deep, going back over 70 years, so there are some different values that we need to be sensitive to, in order to win them over as customers. There are three marketing considerations we will be discussing: Using Facebook, taking time to build trust and relationships with the Boomers and using print articles.

First of all, when it comes to social media platforms, Facebook is king with the Baby Boomers. The vast majority of Boomers are on at least one social media platform. As a matter of fact, the average Boomer is on 4.6 media platforms, but the most popular is Facebook.  A recent 2016 study by the Colorado University study indicated that Facebook is more than twice as popular as LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter and nine times more popular than Instagram with the Boomer crowd. Facebook is so popular with the Baby Boomer demographic that over 15% of Baby Boomers have reported spending 11 hours or more a week on Facebook. Several additional studies have shown that Facebook is the Boomers platform of choice. Facebook is so popular that 15 percent or more boomers are on it at least 11 hours every week. Also, Boomers are more likely to share content on Facebook than any other generation. And they are not just sitting at home on their computer. Over 60% of Boomers have Smartphones, and when they have free time, 40% of them would choose reading as their preferred way to spend their leisure time, and 21% would choose being on their computers. This does not sound like an old crowd, although they do have what some would call old-fashioned habits and values.

This brings us to the second strategy for marketing to Baby Boomers. It’s really less of a strategy and more of a reminder. Keep Baby Boomer values in the forefront of your mind when designing a marketing strategy. Boomers are loyal. They will be your customer, they will stay with you, but first you have to earn their loyalty by building trust and keeping promises. Get them engaged, have patience and answer all questions. Have customer service ready and available to help. Return calls and emails in a timely fashion. Follow through on promises. For example, if you promise a weekly newsletter or blog post, don’t skip a week and think they won’t notice. One big way to build trust is to be consistent and follow through on promises. A boomer may think that if you can’t follow through on a weekly newsletter, how can you follow through on your claims of excellent customer service and reliability?

All of this may take some time. It will be worth it in the end. It takes time to build rapport and trust with a customer. Generations after the Boomers, such as the Millennial Generation and <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/generation-x-managers-learners-who-lead/"">Gen X</a>, tend to be more impulsive and will surf the net for the best price, and purchase more quickly. Baby Boomers will need to take some time, do some research and a lot of thinking before making the final decision to purchase. Consider having social media posts that allow the Boomers to give their opinion about your product or service, and make sure you respond to them and their concerns. This way they will feel more personally connected to your company, and don’t feel disconnected and the transaction doesn’t seem so impersonal. Don’t be frustrated by this. Expect it and be prepared to spend the time.

Lastly, remember, with the Baby Boomers, good old-fashioned print articles still matter. According to research, Baby Boomers are significantly more likely to engage with text articles than other generations. When marketing to baby boomers you should still consider direct mail marketing campaigns. They work, especially if they are creative, thoughtful, and keep the values of this generation in mind. Since the Boomers are online in record numbers, and still love print articles, is there a way you can be creative and perhaps market using online brochures? Boomers need to feel a sense of connection, rapport and relationship. One of the great things about print articles it that they can tell a story, and make a more personal connection. Since building trust is still important, perhaps you could try marketing to Baby Boomers using YouTube videos be used to showcase positive customer testimonials about your product or service?

In conclusion, it is easy to see that the <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/15-facts-you-need-to-know-about-baby-boomers/"">Baby Boomers</a> are a force to be reckoned with. Their numbers are vast, their values clear and strong, and many are living a very active <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/baby-boomers-lifestyle-trends-to-follow-in-2018/"">lifestyle</a>. When marketing to Baby Boomers, it helps to understand their strong values and what drives them. For example, they did not grow up with much of the technology that is in use today, but they do not shy away from it either. They use technology as a means to an end. Knowing that helps to understand their love of Facebook because of the power to connect to friends and family. They are thoughtful, cautious, loyal and will be great customers once they are convinced that their opinions and concerns are heard and addressed.",,"2019-09-09 12:22:33",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=5695,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/marketing-to-baby-boomers-2019.jpg,"marketing to baby boomers",,,"marketing to baby boomers",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/marketing-to-baby-boomers-2019.jpg,,"Quick Thoughts","generation myth","baby|baby boomer|baby boomer generation|baby boomers|boomer generation|boomers|generation|marketing to baby|marketing to baby boomers|media platforms|online in record numbers|print articles|social media|social media platform|social media platforms|strategy for marketing to baby|united states|war ii|world war|world war ii",,,,,,,84,,,"marketing to baby boomers",,"Marketing to Baby Boomers: It is easy to see that the Baby Boomers are a force to be reckoned with.

5707,"Generational Marketing Consultant: How can it help my business?","In this article we will explore how you can use a marketing consultant to help your business grow. Specifically, how a Generational Marketing Consultant can help you refine your business focus, get new clients, and help you better meet the needs of your existing customers! First we will discuss what a Generational Marketing Consultant does - in broad terms. We will talk about the very powerful advantages to your company that come about from using the services of a Generational Marketing Consultant. Lastly, we will list some pragmatic reasons why Generational Marketing Consultants make sense for your business.
<h3>What is a Generational Marketing Consultant?</h3>
A Generational Marketing Consultant is someone who specializes in creating and implementing marketing plans and using strategies that center on the products and services your company provides. A Generational Marketing Consultant will give you different services than say, an advertising firm. Advertisers would get to know your key messages, create ads that will entice new customers to buy your product or engage your service or purchase your product. A Generational Marketing Consultant can help you find new clients and generate new leads and in addition, the Generational Marketing Consultant will help you understand how to better engage the customers you already have, and help you understand how to convert new leads into satisfied customers. Because they are experts at analyzing data, they will be able to help expand your base of clients by understanding how to market to the unique values, motivations and needs of different generations.

Many marketing consultants specialize in a certain area, such as online marketing strategies. Generational Marketing Consultants specialize in creating marketing plans that help a business target the unique needs, motivations, values and preferences of the five generations that are currently in our workforce. That’s right, five! The five generations are known as the Traditionalists, those who were born before 1946. Next come the Baby Boomers. They are generally identified as those born anywhere from 1946 to 1964. After Boomers comes Generation X, a moniker attached to the babies born between 1965 and 1976. Next, Generation Y, otherwise known as the Millennials. The Millennials were born between 1977 and 1997. Lastly, Generation Z is the name we call those born after approximately 1997 - 2012.

<h3>Why do I need a Generational Marketing Consultant?</h3>
There are many reasons why you should consider hiring a Generational Marketing Consultant. As the leader in your business, think about some of the following symptoms that may indicate a deeper malady. For example, do you feel that your business is stagnating? Do you have a great product or service and feel like you should be generating more sales, but your growth has hit a plateau and sales figures have leveled off? A Generational Marketing Consultant can help analyze data to discover where to focus your time and energy to rectify that situation.

Perhaps you feel like you are not connecting with your customers as deeply as you would like? The strategies you used to employ with great success don’t seem to have the same impact anymore. For example, have you done a direct mail marketing campaign recently? Direct mailings used to work great, but this time it did not generate any new leads? Or perhaps you have felt that you have too many irons in the fire? In other words, you feel that your company is going in too many directions at once, and has lost the laser-like focus that you had when you started the company? A Generational Marketing Consultant can lead the discussion with you and your team to help refocus your business mission and vision, and help you understand which marketing campaigns work with each of your client bases. Maybe direct mail campaigns do still work, but perhaps  not with Generation Z clients? Would Facebook ads appeal to Baby Boomers over 60 years old? A Generational Marketing Consultant will help you understand generational differences, and be your guide leading you in the right direction to wisely spend your marketing budget.

As mentioned before, there are five generations currently in the workforce. Each of these generations have unique characteristics and values that vastly change the strategies one would employ when marketing to each generation. According to a Pew research study, The Baby Boomers, born from 1946-1964 living through the Great Depression and World War II most value honesty and work ethic. Now lets - contrast that with Generation Z consumers. According to a recent Forbes Magazine article, by the year 2020, Gen Z will account for a jaw-dropping 40% of all consumers! This generation was born with the internet, and grew up with SmartPhones in their hands. When marketing to a Baby Boomer, taking time to create a relationship and trust is very important. Generation Z consumers main focus is value. You could put out the fanciest, glossy advertisement, and Gen Z consumers would most likely just scroll right past the ad. They want to know how your product or service, and your company and it’s resources, can help them. This is very different from Baby Boomers. That is just one example of how generational marketing is complex and complicated. I firmly believe that the investment of time and resources to understand how to create value and market to each of the five generations can pay off in huge dividends. I also feel the opposite is true. If a company decides to ignore employees and customers generational differences by just doing the ""status quo"" in terms of marketing, sales and advertising - that business is doomed to fail. A Generational Marketing Consultant can help you navigate the desires, motivations, influences, values and needs of these vastly different generations.

You will also benefit from the services of a Generational Marketing Consultant if you feel your business is doing well, but you want to know how you are doing in more <em>concrete</em> terms. You don’t want to just go by your ""feeling"" and ""gut instinct"" -  you want hard data. A marketing consultant help you decide which key metrics would be best to keep track of for your particular business. Would it be best to keep track of website traffic? If you have a brick-and-mortar store, perhaps data on daily foot traffic is what you need. Do you question how many people are engaged in your businesses social media platforms? What about the all-important lead to sales conversion ratios? How have you been doing lately on that metric? All of these questions can be answered with the specialized skills of a Generational Marketer.

Speaking of social media, a Generational Marketing Consultant knows with incredible depth what kind of social media platforms and messages appeal to each of the five generations. Do those consumers in the Baby Boomer Generation, born between 1946 and 1964, even use social media? If so, which platform do they use the most? There is one social media platform that is most preferred by the Baby Boomer Generation, and with the millions of Americans in this generation, the wise business owner should know precisely what kind of platform to use, and what kind of message to craft, that will most appeal to this group of affluent consumers. Don’t worry if you don’t already know, your Generational Marketing Consultant will have all the information you need!
<h3>A Generational Marketing Consultant can help convert leads to clients</h3>
One of the most important reasons to hire a Generational Marketing Consultant is directly related to your bottom line. If your organization is in a situation where sales have leveled off, and growth is not hitting projections - it makes sense to bring in an a 3rd party expert. <em>If the situation sounds like this:</em> you seem to get a decent amount of leads and inquiries into your business, but you have difficulty with the conversion of those leads into paying clients. Through careful data analysis and an in-depth understanding of your business, products and services, a Generational Marketing Consultant can help you determine what business strategies you need to employ to increase the all-important conversion rate.

Hiring a marketing consultant for your business can be useful. Acquiring the services of a Generational Marketing Consultant will be the difference between growth and stagnation for your company. The world has changed. The advent of the internet and smart phones has changed the world in a few short years - perhaps more than any other innovation in history. Technology has changed the way we interact socially, how we spend our free time, how we shop, how we buy and how we create, disseminate and use information. The wise business leader will begin to notice how these trends affect their bottom line today, and into the future. The use of technology is just one way the world has changed. Business owners must be aware of the vast differences in the generations that currently makeup their workforce and their customer base. The business owner must be aware, but there is no need to become an expert. The experts in this complex, and fascinating field are already out there. Generational Marketing Consultants. It is getting increasingly difficult to identify exactly where a business should invest their marketing budget. Life used to be more simple. A business could do television, radio or print ads. After World War II, the vast majority of consumers were the same age, had the same general values and had similar needs. Now the needs of the five generations are different and the type, variety, style, content and frequency of applicable marketing strategies must change, expand and be flexible for each generation.

5742,"Marketing Consultant: How can hiring one help my business?","The term Marketing Consultant may generate questions in some people’s minds. What does a Marketing Consultant do? What special skills do Marketing Consultants possess? Perhaps the most important question about a Marketing Consultant is: does my business need one? This article will attempt to answer all of those questions and more about the role of the Marketing Consultant.
<h3>When did the term Marketing Consultant originate?</h3>
To understand the role of the Marketing Consultant in today’s modern world, it is interesting and informative to go back to the very beginning, to the roots of the Marketing Consultant. The term marketing was first note in print in the 1500’s, when it began to appear in dictionaries of the time. The word comes from the Latin mercatus, meaning marketplace or merchant. This is in reference to the process of buying or making products and selling those products at a market.

Contrast that simple 500-year-old definition with the recent definition of marketing put forth by the American Marketing Association. They define marketing as ""the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."" A bit more complicated than the original definition, but if you look closely at the essence, the definitions are the same: buying and selling products. The difference comes in with the deliberate nuance with which marketing can target specific audiences today, and the tremendously increased complexity of the modern marketplace. This complexity is exactly why businesses need marketing consultants. The world is too complex, and marketing is too important to your business, not to have a trained professional that specializes in marketing in this multi-faced, online world. So now you know you would benefit from a Marketing Consultant. But what exactly does a Marketing Consultant do?
<h3>What a Marketing Consultant does</h3>
To begin to understand what a Marketing Consultant does, let’s start with a quote from the pen of the business guru Peter F. Drucker himself. Drucker wrote that “The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself.”

This definition fits the essence of marketing and the Marketing Consultant. The main job of the Marketing Consultant is as simple, and as complex, as understanding the customer. Understanding the customer, the business, the values, the drive behind the business is a necessary first step any Marketing Consultant should attempt. This may seem counter-intuitive. Why not just pay the Marketing Consultant, have them look around the website and the office, and create a marketing campaign to help with sales? Why not put some stuff online too--maybe an add on Facebook? Maybe you get them popping up all the time when you are browsing around. If a Marketing Consultant jumped right in like that, I would recommend running in the other direction. That would be like a doctor prescribing medication before they have had a chance to diagnose what is going on with you. Just like a doctor getting to know you before helping, a good Marketing Consultant must first listen. That is correct. Listen. They should sit down with you, the client, and get to know you. What do you value? What gets you up early and has you stay up late? What are you passionate about? What is the value that customers get out of buying their product or service. To help explain why listening is a vital first step in the consulting process, let us take a look at one of the ten most influential business books ever written, Stephen Covey’s 7 <em>Habits of Highly Effective People</em>. If you haven’t read it in a while, rest assured that Franklin-Covey does brisk business with training of organizations of all sizes and types, to get this inspired wisdom out to the business community. If you have never read the book, the 7 habits are:
<ol>
 	<li>Be Proactive</li>
 	<li>Begin with the End in Mind</li>
 	<li>Put First Things First</li>
 	<li>Think Win Win</li>
 	<li>Seek First to Understand, Then be Understood,</li>
 	<li>Synergize</li>
 	<li>Sharpen the Saw.</li>
</ol>
These are all noble habits to incorporate into one’s life, but for this article, let us focus in on Habit 5, Seek First to Understand, Then be Understood. If a Marketing Consultant wants to be successful, this is the beginning of every client interaction. A competent Marketing Consultant would start with telling the client about the research they have conducted on their business model, and then offer suggestions, perhaps even a fully realized marketing plan, to help the customer with their bottom line. In contrast, a wise Marketing Consultant would not start by telling the customer anything. The successful Marketing Consultant would start by asking the customer a question, such as “How are you doing today”?
<h3>The secret all Marketing Consultants should know</h3>
Seeking First to Understand can be frustrating for someone not in the habit of listening. Many people appear to be listening when they are in a conversation, but what is really happening inside their head is not listening to the speaker, but simply waiting until the speaker is done, so that they can tell the listener what their own thoughts are on the topic. If a Marketing Consultant truly wants to be of service to the customer, they must understand the secret of Habit 5, Seek First to Understand, Then be Understood. That secret is this. Everyone sees the world differently. However, everyone thinks that everyone else sees the world the same way they do. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is only through intense listening, conscious questioning and thoughtful reflection that another person can understand the viewpoint of another. Once the Marketing Consultant understands and can see the world, the business and the products or service as the client sees them, only then can the Marketing Consultant begin to serve the client in any meaningful way.

The Marketing Consultant understands that this is not a one time only endeavor. Understanding the customer is a continuous process. Talking and understanding the client is an essential first step, but it is not a one-off task. The wise Marketing Consultant uses a plethora of tools, including customer surveys, collecting online user data from social media sites and using focus groups are a few of the ways that Marketing Consultants continuously work to deeply understand the client and the customer base.
<h3>Is there a difference between selling and marketing?</h3>
The terms selling and marketing have often been used in the literature as interchangeable, synonyms for the same type of service. This is far from the truth. Selling is simply the exchange of cash for the purchase of a product. The end result of marketing should be sales however marketing is, at its heart, understanding, meeting and satisfying the customer needs.
<h3>Marketing Concepts</h3>
Many experts agree that there are distinct concepts in marketing. These concepts can be organized into five broad categories: Production concept, product, selling concept marketing concept, and societal marketing concept. A Marketing Consultant can help with every one of these steps, from bring a new product to life, to marketing to specific niches in society. With the advice and assistance from a Marketing Consultant, a business can create and maintain lasting relationships with their customers. This customer loyalty can increase the visibility of the brand and keep current customers, and can also help attract new clients to the product or service. This in turn will help generate traffic to your business, whether it is foot traffic to a brick and mortar store, or online traffic for an e-commerce site.
<h3>What are marketing strategies?</h3>
When discussing marketing strategies, it is helpful to think of them in two broad categories: offline and online. Offline strategies are the more traditional methods of marketing such as print adds, radio and television spots, and even attending conferences and trade shows in person.

Online marketing strategies can be an essential component to any successful marketing campaign. These can be a part, but are not a necessary part of every marketing campaign. The underlying reason for this is the concept of Generational Marketing. There are five distinct generations currently in our workforce and in the marketplace, and each generation has distinct needs, desires, preferences and motivations. What works with one generation may not appeal to another. To learn more about this, check out my blogs on the topic of Generational Marketing, such as

</ul>
To find out more about marketing to specific generations, such as the Baby Boomers, read <a href=""https://www.alexisabramson.com/buying-habits-of-baby-boomers/"">Boomer Consumer Part 3: Buying Habits of the Baby Boomers </a>for some fascinating information that can help your business grow.

Online marketing strategies are becoming more and more important to businesses.When it comes to online marketing strategies, content is king. Specifically, new content that is informative and engaging to the consumer. There are many ways to engage customers online now, including blogs, social media posts, and even videos about your product or service. Having new content is important for something called Search Engine Optimization, or SEO. If you haven’t heard about this concept, you need to look into a company that can optimize your SEO. Research has shown that most people who do a search for a product, business or service almost always exclusively look at the first page of search results. So you want to find ways to optimize that search so that when your business, product or service is being searched for, your business comes up on the first page of search results. There is an entire science behind SEO, so it is suggested that you engage the service of professionals to help you create this optimization of your website.

Ideally then, a Marketing Consultant will work with you, your clients and your business to understand what you value personally, and what you value as a company and why you believe in your product or service. The Marketing Consultant will then be able to help you understand exactly how to market your product or service best to fulfill a need in any of the five generations currently in the workplace. The Marketing Consultant will know which generations will respond better to print adds, radio and tv spots or Facebook ads, and which would respond to social media posts, blogs and informative videos.

Marketing has been around for more than five hundred years. While the tools of marketing have changed, the essence of marketing has not. Marketing is still about buying or producing products and selling those on the market. The market is much more multi-layered and complex than it was 500 years ago. With several generations of consumers in play, along with the vast array of online and off line marketing strategies, the hiring of a competent, experience marketing consultant, especially one who specializes in Generational Marketing",,"2020-07-08 14:37:10",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/?p=5742,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_251503399.jpeg,"Marketing Consultant",,,"Marketing Consultant",https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_251503399.jpeg,,"Quick Thoughts","generation myth","5 seek first to understand|business|consultant|first to understand|generational marketing|habit 5 seek|marketing campaign|marketing consultant|marketing consultants|marketing strategies|online marketing strategies|product or service|role of the marketing|role of the marketing consultant|seek first to understand|social media|term marketing|term marketing consultant|understanding the customer|wise marketing consultant",,,,,,,96,,,"Marketing Consultant","Marketing Consultant: Can hiring a Marketing Consultant help?","Marketing Consultant: The term Marketing Consultant may generate questions in some people’s minds.

5751,"Marketing Consultants: Tips on hiring the best one!","<p>You may be looking for a Marketing Consultant because you heard that hiring one can help your business. Maybe someone you know had a good experience with a Marketing Consultant, and they convinced you to look into getting one. Whatever your reasons are, this article will give you five tips to help guide you in the steps necessary for deciding if you need a Marketing Consultant and if you do need one, some ideas on how to hire a good one!</p>
<h3>Do I need a Marketing Consultant?</h3>
<p>Before you begin to look for a Marketing Consultant, here is a great tip and a necessary first step: do some soul-searching and determine if you need a Marketing Consultant in the first place. If so, why do you need one? What do you want to accomplish hiring a Marketing Consultant? What do you want to have or be able to do differently as a result of this person entering your business sphere? Below are five things to consider to help you with your decision to determine what kind of help you really need.</p>
<h3>Five things to consider before hiring a Marketing Consultant</h3>
<p>
<ol>
 	<li>You may need a Marketing Consultant if you need more brain power. This has nothing to do with how deep your talent pool is in your business. As a business owner, you may be at the point in your business growth that you need clearly defined goals for your company. Those goals can help you identify your market, which will lead to the creation of a marketing campaign. These campaigns should be based on data and filled with strategies to keep current customers satisfied and to attract new clientele. Those are certainly noble pursuits, but maybe you are a small business owner and don’t have the time or resources to gather data, develop a focussed business plan and brainstorm marketing strategies. Even if you have talented people on your staff, you still have to have the manpower to keep the business running, and can’t afford to take them off their normal duties to take on large projects like this.</li>
 	<li>You may need a Marketing Consultant if you find yourself going around and putting out fires all the time. It seems like you have time left over at the end of the day to work on long-range projects. There is a difference between working on what is important, and what is urgent. You have to do the day-to-day work of keeping the business going. That is urgent work because it must be done, and it is important because without the work being done, there is no business! However, there are things that are not urgent, but vitally important. In the business world, this could be such tasks as long-range planning, or creating a mission and vision for your companies future. These are very important tasks, but they are not urgent. If you did not do them today, your business would not come to a halt. However, these are examples of the very tasks that are important, perhaps most important, to the long-term health and prosperity of your company. How can you take the time out of the whirlwind of the day-to-day operations and give these important tasks the thoughtful focus that they need? One solution would be to hire a Marketing Consultant. A Marketing Consultant would be able to engage your staff in the processes needed to focus on the important, not urgent tasks.</li>
 	<li>You may need a Marketing Consultant if you someone with specialized skills. Let’s face it, some of the specialized skills you may need at some point in your business’s growth may not exist in your current staff. Perhaps you need someone to guide your senior management in a process to create a vision and mission for your company. Perhaps you need someone to gather and analyze data about your customer base. Maybe you realize that a new product isn’t selling as well as you would like, but you do not understand why. For each one of these unique situations, there are Marketing Consultants in the field that have the skills needed to help. Employees with highly specialized skills are valuable, but they are needed in the daily operations of the business. To pull them off of their regular duties and assign them long-term project work may not be the best use of that valuable human resource.</li>
 	<li>You may need a Marketing Consultant if you have some difficult decisions to make. In the life of any human organization, at some point, there are polarizing decisions that need to be made. Making the decision to choose one action over another can be fraught with emotions and loyalties within the ranks. As the leader, you know what needs to be done, and you also know that, while many people are very resilient, some people are much more fragile. If you choose the difficult, but the correct path, you know that the emotional fallout from that decision for some of your key workers will be insurmountable, and make it impossible for you to keep a collegial working relationship with them. Enter the Marketing Consultant. A Marketing Consultant can come into the situation, without emotional bias or any loyalties except to the greater good of the company. This can make it easier to make difficult recommendations that will lead the company down the correct path while preserving the working relationships and feelings of key employees.</li>
 	<li>You may need a Marketing Consultant if you need some perspective. Many people, when faced with difficult decisions or challenges in their lives, turn to a professional counselor or life coach.  From them, they can get unbiased opinions and guidance on next steps and objective feedback on how they are doing.  We do this in our personal lives, why not do the same in our professional lives as well? A Marketing Consultant will get to know you, your drives and motivations, your passions and purpose, and will be able to be the guide on the side, advising you and giving you feedback. If any of these conditions exist, you may want to begin to look for a consultant.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Tips on hiring the best Marketing Consultant</h3>
<p>There are many Marketing Consultants in the field. To find the best fit for you, you may want to consider the following tips for hiring the best Marketing Consultant, and getting the most out of them once you have hired them.</p>
<p>
<ol>
 	<li>First of all, think about the list above. Do you need a Marketing Consultant? If so, what do you need them to do? Is it gather data or someone to be objective and guide a tough decision? Once you have this clear in your mind, the hiring decision for the right Marketing Consultant will become more clear.</li>
 	<li>You have decided you need a Marketing Consultant, but do you understand exactly what problem you want them to help solve? If you hire a consultant to help you build a faster boat, you may want to think that through. What kind of assumptions are you making? Perhaps you just want a faster way to get from one island to the next in your exotic location! If that is the case, then all sorts of possibilities open up. You could hire a bridge builder, or consolidate your holdings in one location. Truly understanding the problem you want to solve, and having a firm grasp of your goals and what you want to accomplish, can help you the most out of hiring a Marketing Consultant.</li>
 	<li>Are you willing to change? If you are hiring a Marketing Consultant, by definition it is inviting change into your organization. Hiring a Marketing Consultant does not imply that what you are doing now is bad or wrong. It does fully support the idea of ongoing, constant innovation. When looking for a Marketing Consultant, find one that you believe won’t be a yes man, and tell you what you want. Find someone who will tell you the truth, even if it hurts! A Marketing Consultant can be a valuable resource in helping with bringing about change in the organization. You have to be ready to accept any and all feedback. Could you have a growth mindset and accept that may be part of the problem is you?</li>
 	<li>Find someone you get along with, someone you like, someone you think you can trust. You will end up having some deep conversations with this person, so you want to be comfortable with them. Also, don’t bend to pressure and hire someone who is related to someone who you as a favor. This is too important of a decision. Find someone you like, check references, and go with them, not the CFO’s son-in-law.</li>
 	<li>Along the same lines, find someone who is interested in you and your business. In other words, someone who is willing to listen and to give advice and create strategies and plans for you.  You do not want a regurgitated or adapted plan they used on a different job. Find someone who will customize their wisdom, knowledge and skills for your benefit in your unique situation.</li>
 	<li>Once you hire the Marketing Consultant, don’t let that be the end of your interactions with them. Talk to them, consult with them, get regular updates, make sure they are on the path you want them to be on. If they are, of course, don’t be timid about giving them feedback. They are your partner in this endeavor. Like any relationship, make sure to air any grievances, give praise when it is deserved, and continually communicate.</li>
</ol><p>
The goal of this article was to give you some food for thought to consider if you need a Marketing Consultant in the first place. Perhaps you need more brain power. You may have all the talent you need in your organization, but you can’t afford to take them out of the whirlwind of the daily workload, so a consultant could be someone who can help. A Marketing Consultant may be of help if you find yourself spending your time on the daily operations, and have a difficult time working on the more long-term, important aspects of the business. Marketing Consultants can also be of use for their specialized skills. Whether it is data gathering and analysis or creating strategies and marketing plans, a Marketing Consultant could be helpful. Using a Marketing Consultant as a counselor and sounding board for important decisions, or just to give you an objective perspective, can also be invaluable. Think about the tips for hiring the right Marketing Consultant, and tips on how to get the most out of the Marketing Consultant once you hire them. Find someone you like, you can be honest with and feel that they will be honest with you. Keep up the lines of communication and give feedback and praise, and redirect them if necessary. Having a Marketing Consultant on your team can be an invaluable resource and one that can help your business immeasurably.

I went on to further the internal dialogue by contemplating whether the societal narrative stating that millennials are lazy, job changers, insecure, unmotivated, etc - was just some idea that was conceptualized in a random researchers head and popularized by keen marketers and the media? After much debate, still only happening subconsciously in my head, I decided that there was a distinct likelihood that this might be the case. But how could an expert Gerontologist be fooled so easily and convinced that all of the monikers attached to the millennial generation were actually empirically proven? Armed with this doubt I decided to set out and prove my hypothesis that ""millennials are actually upstanding members of society"" (even though they are still young) by taking a deep dive into how the term millennial even came into existence. According to Wikipedia (the definitive source) authors William Strauss and Neil Howe are widely credited with naming the millennials. They coined the term in 1991 (some say 1987), around the time children born in 1982 were entering kindergarten, and the media outlets were first identifying their prospective link to the impending new millennium as the high school graduating class of 2000. But here’s the crazy part....the entire set of conclusions that they drew around millennials (and their characteristics) were drawn from the following research.....

6095,"BEWARE: Romance Scams","The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received more than 25,000 reports about romance scams last year alone. Data from the agency revealed that consumers reported losing $201 million to romance scams last year - up nearly 40% from the year before. Also, there has been a threefold increase in romance scams just in the last three years. Individuals currently report losing more money to romance scams than to any other fraud reported to the FTC.

According to the FTC, the older the victim, the more massive the financial toll. The median individual loss for people aged 70 and over is approximately $10,000, compared to $2,600 for all victims. We can assume that these surprising facts and figures are rather conservative as victims report feeling more embarrassed and ashamed when they have fallen for a romance scam than any other type of fraud. With that in mind, it is highly unlikely that your aging loved one will tell you that they were a victim of a romance scam, and they are certainly not likely to report it to the authorities.

The most experienced offenders manage to skillfully secure your loyalty, trust, and in the case of romance scammer’s, emotions without your ever knowing anything nefarious is happening. Fraudsters are willing to go to any and all lengths to get what they are hunting for and will stop at nothing to accomplish their goal of compromising your emotional well-being and separating you and your aging loved ones, from your hard-earned cash and personal data. The tactics used by romance scammers to fool older victims are endless; here are a few examples to look out for especially if you are active on online dating websites.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Fake Credentials:</strong> Dishonesty is second nature for romance scammers, and they will embellish their profiles to appeal to the most vulnerable targets. Romance scammers commonly lie about their background and professional life. They’ll often say they’re working outside of the United States to avoid lengthy phone conversations by using the time difference as an excuse or stating that they are too far away to visit. The most common bogus professional titles romance scammers use is that they have a job on an oil rig, are stationed in the military, or work as a doctor with an international organization.</li>
 	<li><strong>Erratic Emotions:</strong> Fraudsters who operate in this space are found to be extremely persistent and very clever. Romance scammers will execute strategies on both ends of the continuum ranging from acting extremely devoted to instilling tremendous fear their victims’ minds. One minute they are professing their undying love, and in a sudden shift, they will threaten their target by pressuring them into handing over copious amounts of money.</li>
 	<li><strong>Phony Photos:</strong> Predictably, romance scammers do not want to reveal their actual identity, so they often copy or steal a headshot image from the internet for their online profile. Luckily you can conduct an online image search of your new love interest’s photo using your favorite search engine to verify their identity.To check to see if someone is catfishing you, baiting you with a fake identity on a social networking service, you can perform what is referred to as reverse image search on Google. Be aware it gets problematic when a scammer uses software that allows them to merge several pictures into one because unless that exact image has been used before, which is highly unlikely in this case, you will not be able to find a replica of the photo online.
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li>Go to the <a href=""https://www.google.com.ph/imghp?ref=syn_article_candy"">Google Images’</a> homepage (images.google.com).</li>
 	<li>Click the camera icon.</li>
 	<li>Go to “Upload an Image.” Alternatively, you can upload the image URL of any photo you find online.</li>
 	<li>Once uploaded, Google will display all of the websites that contain the referenced photo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Forced Silence:</strong> Romance scammers often insist their targets keep quiet about their bogus relationship and refrain from sharing what the <em>lovely couple</em> has been doing. These scammers are clearly trying to prevent a family member or friend from stopping the fake scam in its tracks. Common Signs You Might be Involved in a Relationship with a Romance Scammer:
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li>The individual hasn’t met you in person but is already professing their eternal love and desire to be in a long-term commitment.</li>
 	<li>They tell you early on, often referred to as the “honeymoon phase,” that they need money for travel, car repairs, emergencies, etc.</li>
 	<li>They say they’re going to come to visit you and ask you to purchase an airline ticket in their name or provide gas money but always cancel at the last minute due to some ""emergency"" situation.</li>
 	<li>The fraudster attempts to persuade you to move off the online dating website to avoid being caught participating in malicious activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

6099,"Seniors Lose 3B Annually Due to Scams","Seniors lose an estimated $2.9 billion annually from financial exploitation, according to the Senate Special Committee on Aging. Impersonating the IRS was the No. 1 scam targeting seniors in 2019. More than 1,500 seniors across the country contacted the committee’s fraud hotline in 2019; however, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt states that only 1 in every 24 cases of elder exploitation gets reported. “Despite that under-reporting, statistically one in every 10 Americans age 65 or older who lives at home will become a victim of abuse,” he wrote. Here are the top 10 scams targeting seniors last year, according to the Senate aging committee’s <a href=""https://www.collins.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019%20Fraud%20Book.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2019 Fraud Book</a>:

<b>1. IRS impersonators: </b>More than 2.4 million Americans have been targeted by scammers impersonating IRS officials and more than 14,700 taxpayers have lost more than $72.8 million since 2013, according to the <a href=""https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/semiannual/semiannual_sept2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration</a>. In this case, criminals generally threaten victims with owing back taxes and warn foreclosure, arrest, or deportation if a payment isn’t made.

<b>2. Robocalls: </b>Nearly <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/fcc-initiatives/fccs-push-combat-robocalls-spoofing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2.4 billion robocalls</a> are made each month, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Often originated overseas, callers mask their identities with fake phone numbers and pretend to be from the government or assume a false identity, in efforts to obtain personal information.

<b>3. Sweepstakes scam/Jamaican lottery scam: </b>Sweepstakes scammers falsely claim seniors have won a lottery and need to pay a fee to collect their winnings. The number of sweepstakes scams increased by 45.8 percent between 2013 and 2017, according to the FCC. Sweepstakes scams often come from a “876” number, the country code for Jamaica. At its peak, it was estimated that sophisticated Jamaican con artists placed approximately 30,000 phone calls to the U.S. each day and stole $300 million a year from tens of thousands of seniors, according to law enforcement and FairPoint Communications.

<b>4. Computer tech support fraud: </b>Microsoft estimates that 3.3 million Americans are victims of technical support scams annually, with losses of roughly $1.5 billion per year. Scammers usually pretend to be a reputable technology company like<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT"">Microsoft</a>,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL"">Apple</a> or Dell. They convince victims that their computer has a virus and persuade them to provide personal information and bank account numbers.

<strong>5. Elder financial abuse: </strong>“Financial exploitation of older Americans is the illegal or improper use of an older adults fund’s property, or assets,” according to the Fraud Book. Seniors lose an estimated $2.9 billion annually due to financial exploitation, although these numbers are likely substantially under-reported, according to the Government Accountability Office. Scammers can include family members, paid home-care workers or strangers who take advantage of seniors’ financial decision-making.

<strong>6. Grandparent scams:</strong> An increasingly popular scam is the “grandparent scam,” where impostors either pretend to be the victims’ grandchild or claim to be holding the victims’ grandchild. They ask for money and usually never call back.

<b>7. Romance frauds: </b><b></b>Romance scams exploit seniors’ loneliness and vulnerability. Twelve percent of people ages 55 to 64 reported using an online dating site or mobile dating app, according to the Pew Research Center. Victims are contacted through a dating site and after trust is built between the two parties, the scammer asks for money for medical emergencies, hotel expenses, hospital bills or visas or other official documents.

<strong>8. Fake Social Security calls:</strong> Similar to the IRS scam, individuals pretend to work for the Social Security Administration and ask for victims’ Social Security number, date of birth, maiden name and bank account information.

<strong>9. Lawsuit or arrest threats: </strong>In the impending lawsuit scam, victims are called by someone pretending to be from a law enforcement agency. The scammers threaten a lawsuit or explain a warrant is out for the victim’s arrest if they do not pay a fine immediately. Often, the caller says the penalty was issued for failing to report for jury duty or not paying taxes.

<strong>10. Identity theft: </strong>Identity theft was the second-most common type of consumer complaint in 2017, with 371,061 complaints, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Nearly 4 of 10 identity theft complaints reported to the FTC in 2017 came from consumers ages 50 and over. Identity thieves not only drain bank accounts and charge credit cards, but they also defraud the government and taxpayers by using stolen personal information to submit fraudulent billings to Medicare and Medicaid.

The Senate aging committee recommends that victims place a fraud alert, report identity theft or file a police report if a scam is suspected.",,"2020-06-20 12:42:53",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/seniors-lose-3b-annually-due-to-scams/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/technology.jpg,technology,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/technology.jpg,,Longevity,,"according|according to the federal|according to the senate|bank account|dating site|financial exploitation|fraud book|identity theft|law enforcement|lose an estimated $2.9|personal information|senate aging|seniors|seniors lose|seniors lose an estimated $2.9|social security|sweepstakes scams|targeting seniors|victims|victims grandchild",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,916,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2020-05-25|2020-05-20,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,,,,,,1,1,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",seniors-lose-3b-annually-due-to-scams,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 14:15:45",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6101,"Identity Theft and COVID-19","According to the FTC’s “<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-2018/consumer_sentinel_network_data_book_2018_0.pdf"">Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book</a>” the most common categories for fraud complaints last year were imposter scams, debt collection and identity theft. Credit card fraud was most prevalent in identity theft cases — more than 167,000 people reported a fraudulent credit card account was opened with their information. However, as the threat of COVID-19 increases, cybercriminals are targeting employees who are working from home. The Federal Trade Commission advises consumers to be wary of cybercriminals exploiting coronavirus fears to steal personally identifiable information (PII). Financial information and medical information is especially sensitive right now.

<strong>Cybersecurity and COVID-19: </strong>Fraudsters are creating scam posts and emails with fake information about COVID-19 - there is also an increased number of hackers creating malicious websites that spoof legitimate public health resources. For example, a link that seems like it should lead you to a map of “COVID-19 cases near me” might actually infect your phone or computer with spyware or ransomware. Remember to visit the Center for Disease Control (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html"">www.cdc.gov</a>) or World Health Organization (<a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"">www.who.int</a>) for accurate, safe information about coronavirus trends and statistics.

Increasingly common <a href=""https://www.identityforce.com/identity-theft/online-scams-coronavirus-email-scams"">COVID-19 scams</a> so far in 2020 include:
<ul>
 	<li>Fraudulent e-commerce vendors for masks, sanitizers and test kits</li>
 	<li>Fraudulent investment sites</li>
 	<li>Phishing and vishing through update emails, texts and voicemails</li>
 	<li>Spoofed government and health organization communications</li>

<strong>5 cybersecurity tips for working from home</strong>

Since so many Americans are settling into their work-from-home routines, we asked ConsumerAffairs’ Information Security team for some tips to stay safe online. For more on how to keep your devices safe while social distancing or sheltering in place, ConsumerAffairs’ Information Security team recommends visiting <a href=""http://sans.org/"">sans.org</a> and <a href=""http://staysafeonline.org/"">staysafeonline.org</a>.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Secure your home network: </strong>Strong passwords and encryption are the best ways to secure your home network. Change your default administrator password before a hacker discovers the manufacturer’s default. Use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption so hackers can’t read information you send. For more guidance, read about <a href=""https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0013-securing-your-wireless-network"">securing your wireless network</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Limit access to your work device: </strong>Avoid giving anyone an opportunity to view confidential material without your authorization. Be sure to shut down or lock your work computer when you aren’t around. It’s too easy for friends and family to erase, modify or infect information on your device accidentally.</li>
 	<li><strong>Careful where you click: </strong>Always hover over links before you click to make sure the hyperlink is the same as the link-to address. Be extra cautious about emails from unknown people — especially if they seem random, illogical or threatening.</li>
 	<li><strong>Be skeptical of job offers: </strong>Cybercriminals use bogus employment posts to trick people into money laundering schemes (“money mules”) and collect their PII or financial information. Remote freelancers could be especially vulnerable.</li>
 	<li><strong>Protect your devices: </strong>If you haven’t already, make sure that your anti-virus and anti-malware software is up to date.</li>

6103,"Be in The Know: Helpful Security Terms","The better consumers understand identity theft, the more equipped they are to protect themselves. The identity theft glossary below is regularly updated to include the most recent identity theft terms that are in the news.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Account takeover:</strong> An account takeover is when a fraudster uses personal information to obtain products and services. Credit card fraud is the most rampant, but skimming and phishing are also common types of account takeovers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Anti-virus:</strong> Anti-virus software runs continuously in the background of a computer and scans for viruses, worms and malware every time the user accesses a website or downloads anything.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bait and switch:</strong> A bait and switch attack is when a hacker buys advertising space on a webpage and then links the advertisement to a page infected with malware.</li>
 	<li><strong>Black hat hacker:</strong> All hackers are capable of compromising computer systems and creating malware, but black hat hackers use these skills to commit cybercrimes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> A blockchain is of a string of time-stamped digital records shared between multiple computers. If the data in one block changes, all subsequent blocks in the blockchain reflect the alteration and become invalid. Blockchains help prevent identity theft and fraud by making it difficult to tamper with the data in a block.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bot:</strong> Short for “robot,” a bot is an autonomous program that interacts with computer systems in a way that appears or attempts to appear human. Hackers can use bots to mine for usernames and passwords used to commit identity fraud.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cookie theft:</strong> Cookie theft is when a cybercriminal makes copies of unencrypted session data and then uses that data to impersonate someone else.</li>
 	<li><strong>Credential cracking:</strong> Credential cracking describes the various methods — word lists, guessing and brute-force — cybercriminals use to obtain passwords. Credential cracking threats are why it’s important to create varied and complicated passwords for all accounts.</li>
 	<li><strong>Criminal impersonation:</strong> Someone commits criminal impersonation when they assume a fake or false identity, usually for political or financial gain.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cybersquatting:</strong> Also sometimes called domain squatting, cybersquatting is when a domain name is stolen or misspelled to attract users for exploitation or profit.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cryptovirology:</strong> Cryptovirology is the study of how cryptology is used to create dangerous malware.</li>
 	<li><strong>Data breach:</strong> A data breach is when private or confidential information is released to an untrusted environment. Cybercriminals can infiltrate a data source physically or remotely bypass network security to expose passwords, banking and credit data, passport and Social Security numbers, medical records and more.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dark web:</strong> The dark web is the part of the internet that can only be accessed through Tor browser software, which keeps visitors anonymous and untraceable. It’s not illegal to be on the dark web, but many illegal transactions occur on the dark web (such as buying credit card or Social Security numbers).</li>
 	<li><strong>Deep web:</strong> The deep web is the part of the internet that’s not accessible through standard search engines such as Google or Bing. Password-protected and dynamic pages, encrypted networks and the dark web are all part of the deep web.</li>
 	<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encryption is a way to scrambled data using computer algorithms to prevent unauthorized access to data or sensitive information.</li>
 	<li><strong>Firewall:</strong> In computing, a firewall is a software program that blocks unauthorized users from getting in without restricting outward communication.</li>
 	<li><strong>Formjacking:</strong> Formjacking is when a hacker infiltrates an e-commerce checkout page to steal credit card information. Similar to an ATM skimmer for the internet age.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ghosting:</strong> In the context of identity theft, ghosting refers to when someone steals the identity of a dead person.</li>
 	<li><strong>Grey hat hacker:</strong> Grey hat hackers’ ethics are somewhere between black and white hat hackers. Grey hat hacking involves illegal cyberactivity, but the hacker often reports vulnerabilities to the system’s owner and requests a fee in exchange for the information — if a system's owner does not comply with their request, the grey hat hacker usually exploits the newly discovered cybersecurity vulnerability.</li>
 	<li><strong>Honeypot:</strong> A honeypot is a decoy target used to mitigate cybersecurity risks or get more information about how cybercriminals work.</li>
 	<li><strong>Identity cloning:</strong> Identity cloning is a type of identity theft in which a fraudster assumes someone else’s identity and attempts to live under that assumed identity.</li>
 	<li><strong>Identity score:</strong> Similar to a credit score, an identity score is a system that gauges an individual’s data for legitimacy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Imposter scam:</strong> Imposter scams involve a fraudster posing as a different person for financial or political gain. Usually, the imposter tricks others into giving them money through email, over the phone or via online dating services.</li>
 	<li><strong>Internet of Things:</strong> The Internet of Things, or IoT, describes the interconnectedness of all devices that access WiFi, including cell phones, cameras, headphones and an increasing number of other objects, including washing machines and thermostats.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keylogger:</strong> A keylogger is a computer program that records a person’s keystrokes to obtain confidential data.</li>
 	<li><strong>Malware:</strong> A portmanteau of “malicious” and “software,” malware describes any software created with the specific intent to cause disruption or damage. Trojans, bots, spyware, worms and viruses are all types of malware.</li>
 	<li><strong>Passive attacks:</strong> Any network attack where the system is monitored or scanned for vulnerabilities is considered “passive attack” because the targeted data isn’t modified or damaged.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pharming:</strong> Sometimes called “phishing without a lure,” pharming is a type of scam where malicious code is installed onto a device or server to misdirect users onto illegitimate websites.</li>
 	<li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Phishing is a popular type of internet scam in which fraudsters send emails claiming to be from a reputable company to trick individuals into revealing personal information. Phishing attacks decreased from 1 in 2,995 emails in 2017 to 1 in 3,207 emails in 2018.</li>
 	<li><strong>Physical identity theft:</strong> Unlike wireless identity theft, physical identity theft requires an identity thief to be in close proximity to their target. Examples of physical identity theft include stealing a wallet or computer, dumpster diving and postal mail theft.</li>
 	<li><strong>Proxy server:</strong> A proxy server establishes a substitute IP (Internet Protocol) address identity. When you connect online, your computer’s IP address is transmitted to websites and establishes your location and may give other identifying details. Proxy servers allow users to connect to the internet anonymously and bypass blocked or restricted websites.</li>
 	<li><strong>PowerShell:</strong> An automated task framework by Microsoft, PowerShell can be embedded in applications to automate batch processing and systems management tools.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Ransomware is a type of malware that threatens to expose or block an individual's or business’ data unless a ransom is paid.</li>
 	<li><strong>SIM swap scam:</strong> Sometimes called a port-out scam or SIM splitting, a SIM swap scam is a complex type cell phone fraud that exploits two-factor authentication to access data stored on someone’s cell phone. Put simply, if a fraudster has your phone number, they can call your phone company and ask to have the number transferred to “your” new phone. The fraudster then has access to all of your accounts that use two-factor authentication.</li>
 	<li><strong>Skimming:</strong> Skimming is a type of credit card fraud in which the victim’s account numbers are copied and transferred to a counterfeit card.</li>
 	<li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Similar to phishing, smishing (or SMS phishing) is when someone attempts to mine sensitive information under a fake identity through text messages.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sockpuppet:</strong> Sockpuppetting is when a person assumes a false identity on the internet for the purpose of deception.</li>
 	<li><strong>Spoofing:</strong> A spoofing attack is when an illegitimate website falsifies data to appear as a trustworthy website to visitors.</li>
 	<li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Spyware is any software designed to gather data from an individual or enterprise. The four primary types of spyware are adware, Trojan horses, tracking cookies and system monitors.</li>
 	<li><strong>Synthetic identity theft:</strong> Synthetic identity theft is when a criminal combines stolen and fake information to create a new, fraudulent identity.</li>
 	<li><strong>System monitor:</strong> Much like it sounds, a system monitor is an application that surveils computer activity. System monitors usually run unnoticed and can record passwords, chats and emails, websites visited and other sensitive or identifying data.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tracking cookie:</strong> Websites use tracking cookies to gather and share data from their visitors. Unlike malware, tracking cookies won’t damage computer systems, but they can create privacy concerns.</li>
 	<li><strong>Trojan horse:</strong> Like its classical namesake, a Trojan horse is a type of malware disguised to appear like safe software. Cybercriminals use Trojans to access sensitive data and gain access to private systems.</li>
 	<li><strong>Waterhole attack:</strong> A waterhole attack occurs when a hacker targets a specific group or community. The hacker infects an individual within the targeted group with malware in an attempt to infect the entire group.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wireless identity theft:</strong> Also sometimes called contactless identity theft or RFID identity theft, wireless identity theft is committed by wireless mechanics. Examples of wireless identity theft include phishing and spoofing.</li>
 	<li><strong>Whaling:</strong> Whaling is a phishing attack that targets high-level employees within a company to steal confidential information or sensitive data.</li>
 	<li><strong>White hat hacker:</strong> Unlike a black hat hacker, a white hat hacker uses their ability to break computer networks or bypass security protocols for good rather than evil. White hat hackers are often employed by governments or companies to perform vulnerability assessments.</li>
 	<li><strong>Worm:</strong> A worm is a type of malware that self-replicates and spreads from computer to computer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Virus:</strong> Similar to worms, viruses make copies of themselves. The main difference between viruses and worms is that viruses require a host program to spread.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Like phishing or smishing, vishing is when an identity thief attempts to gain sensitive information over the phone.</li>
 	<li><strong>Zero-day exploit:</strong> A zero-day exploit is when cybercriminals target a software the same day weakness in that software is discovered and before a patch can be released to fix the vulnerability.</li>

6157,"Trends: Personal Identity Theft","The Identity Theft Resource Center (<a href=""https://www.idtheftcenter.org/2019-trends-and-predictions-for-identity-theft-data-privacy-and-cybersecurity/"">ITRC</a>) predicts that during the next 12 months identity theft protection services will primarily focus on data breaches, data abuse and data privacy. ITRC also predicts that consumers will become more knowledgeable about how data breaches work and expect companies to provide more information about the specific types of data breached and demand more transparency in general in data breach reports.

<strong>Cyberattacks are more ambitious</strong>
According to a 2019 <a href=""https://img03.en25.com/Web/Symantec/%7B984e78e2-c9e5-43b8-a6ee-417a08608b60%7D_ISTR_24_2019_April_en.pdf?elqTrackId=136e2f99e16c42e0805cb48597af9016&amp;elqaid=6820&amp;elqat=2"">Internet Security Threat Report</a> by Symantec, cybercriminals are diversifying their targets and using stealthier methods to commit identity theft and fraud. Cybercrime groups like Mealybug, Gallmaker and Necurs are opting for off-the-shelf tools and operating system features such as PowerShell to attack targets.
<ul>
 	<li>Supply chain attacks are up 78%</li>
 	<li>Malicious PowerShell scripts have increased by 1,000%</li>
 	<li>Microsoft Office files make up 48% of malicious email attachments</li>
</ul>
<strong>Internet of Things threats on the rise</strong>
Cybercriminals attack IoT devices an average of 5,233 times per month. Routers and connected cameras were the main targets of IoT attacks in 2018, accounting for about 90% of activity. IoT attacks involving connected cameras increased by about 12% in the last year as well. According to Symantec, cybercriminals most often access IoT devices by using the passwords: 123456, [BLANK], system, sh, shell, admin, 1234, password, enable and 12345.

<strong>Formjacking is up 117%</strong>
More than 57,600 unique websites were compromised by formjacking in 2018, and cybercriminals continue to take in millions each month by hijacking credit card data from online payment forms.

<strong>Ransomware activity is down 20%</strong>
Ransomware attacks decreased last year for the first time since 2013 — identity theft experts suspect this is because ransomware attacks target Windows-based applications and more people are storing and sharing data using the cloud. Ransomware threats remain a risk for businesses, as enterprise ransomware has increased by 12%.

<strong>New account fraud is up 13%</strong>
In 2018, new account fraud accounted for $3.4 billion in losses, up from $3 billion in 2017, according to Javelin Strategy. The most common targets for new account fraud are mortgages, student loans, car loans and credit cards.

<strong>Account takeovers are up 79%</strong>
The number of account takeovers also increased, rising from 380,000 in 2017 to 679,000 in 2018. Both individuals and enterprises are at risk for account takeovers.

<strong>Increased effort to solve the year 2038 problem</strong>
Similar to the Y2K problem, the 2038 problem is a bug that will affect the way computers store time-stamps. Computer logic defines time-stamps with the current date and time, minus the number of seconds that have passed since January 1, 1970, when computers originated. In 2038, the number of elapsed seconds will exceed the information that can be stored in a four-byte data type, meaning most computers will need an extra byte to preserve their timing systems. The 2038 problem will be a logistical nightmare to solve and could affect databases and make private information public. Without a resolution, hackers will likely search for ways to exploit this bug.

<strong>Who is most likely at risk? </strong>Most identity thefts are crimes of opportunity. Identity thieves often target those who don’t regularly check for identity theft warning signs and are unlikely to report irregular activity on their credit reports.

<strong>Children and seniors: </strong>Everyone with a Social Security number is at risk for identity theft, but two demographics are targeted aggressively and often: the very young and the very old.Children are targeted because identity thieves can use a child’s Social Security numbers to establish a fraudulent “clean slate.” Identity theft experts recommend parents monitor their children’s credit reports to check for identity theft as often as their own.Seniors are targeted most often over the telephone and through internet phishing scams. <a href=""https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/brain-changes-trust-rises-age"">Some studies</a> suggest that people become more trusting as they age, which explains why it’s more difficult for older adults to detect fraudsters.

<strong>Members of the military: </strong>While deployed, active duty members of the armed services are particularly vulnerable to identity theft because they may not notice mistakes on their credit reports or receive calls from debt collectors regarding a fraudulent charge. According to FTC reports, military consumers are most affected by credit card and bank fraud.
<ul>
 	<li>All military consumer credit card fraud reports: <strong>10,590</strong></li>
 	<li>2019 total military consumer bank fraud reports: <strong>5,723</strong></li>
</ul>
Military consumers’ reports of employment or tax-related fraud increased by 85% between 2017 and 2018. Military members are also increasingly affected by loan or lease fraud.

<strong> </strong><strong>Social media users: </strong>It’s relatively easy for cybercriminals to discover a person’s name, date of birth, phone number, hometown and other sensitive information through social media and networking sites. With this information, an identity thief can target victims for phishing and imposter scams. Last year, the FTC processed 9,439 email or social media identity theft reports, a 23% increase from 2017.

<strong> </strong><strong>Repeat victims: </strong>People who have previously been affected by identity theft are at a greater risk for future identity theft and fraud. According to the Center for Victim Research, 7-10% of the U.S. population are victims of identity fraud each year, and 21% of those experience multiple incidents of identity fraud. For more information about how victims of identity theft can protect themselves from future fraud, read about the identity theft recovery process.

<strong>The deceased: </strong>Identity thieves can target the recently departed with information gleaned from public obituaries and access the deceased Social Security number through the Social Security Administration’s Master Death File. Stealing a dead person’s identity is commonly referred to as “ghosting.” Ghosting often goes unnoticed by surviving family for months or years. Deceased identities stolen per year: <strong>2.5 million</strong>",,"2020-07-01 16:29:53",post,https://www.alexisabramson.com/trends-personal-identity-theft-2/,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_1174611259.jpg,shutterstock_1174611259,,,,https://www.alexisabramson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_1174611259.jpg,,Security,,"2038 problem|account fraud|account takeovers|check for identity|check for identity theft|credit card|credit reports|fraud|identity|identity theft|identity theft and fraud|identity theft experts|identity thieves|new account fraud|social media|social security|social security number|theft|theft and fraud|victims of identity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5014,,"a:2:{s:6:""family"";a:1:{s:21:""et-gf-source-sans-pro"";s:100:""Source+Sans+Pro:200,200italic,300,300italic,regular,italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,900,900italic"";}s:6:""subset"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""latin"";i:1;s:9:""latin-ext"";}}",,2020-07-14,,#ffffff,light,on,default,et_right_sidebar,off,,,,,,,1,41,,30,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Alexis,alexis@abramson.com,Alexis,"Abramson, Ph.D.",trends-personal-identity-theft-2,,,0,0,0,open,open,"2020-11-19 14:15:25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6199,"How To Recognize a Scam","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To avoid a potentially devastating fraud situation it’s important to talk with your aging loved ones, early and often, about how to recognize common scams and protect themselves from exploitation. I am frequently told that talking about finances is the hardest conversation most families have, especially if there is a concern that there is mishandling or a scam taking place. One of the most important pieces of advice I have for you is be bold, be honest and be </span><b>FIRM</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> when you are having the scam talk. Almost every family that comes to me after they or their loved one has been scammed says, “I only wish I had talked to my aging loved one about this sooner – before she let that swindler take all her money.” </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I recently received a sad phone call from Mary, an older friend who is very close to our family. Her sister Rachel had committed suicide. Mary told me that when she was preparing Rachel’s house for it to be sold’ she found a huge pile of very strange emails back and forth from her sister to an organization in India. The emails said that if her sister did not wire them money, they would send someone to her house to beat her up. The emails revealed that they knew her name, date of birth, address, social security number, and they had a copy of her passport. It turns out Mary’s sister had purchased a cruise online that was from a fraudulent website, and during the process, all of this information was requested. Mary’s sister unsuspectingly provided everything they needed to scam her out of $296,000 - all of her life’s savings! Mary accessed her sister’s computer and found a few email conversations between Rachel and the organization dated the day her sister died. Rachel was trying to explain to the people calling her that she had no more money to send them, and they said they did not believe her and were sending someone to find her. Rachel took her life shortly after she received these threatening emails. When Mary went to close her bank account, Rachel had a remaining balance of $2.75. Don’t let that be you! </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some tips and “conversation starters” to help ease the conversation and </span><b>EMPOWER</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> your aging loved one’s to be on the lookout for these bad characters that are trying to scam them. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Be a Peer, Not a Parent: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s always tricky when you have to talk to your aging loved ones about sensitive subjects like this one. All I can say is, deal with it! With that advice in mind, be thoughtful about how and when you present the information - if you’re at a family reunion – probably not the best time. Right after they returned from a trip to Vegas where they lost $100 on the slot machine – spare them….you get it, I’m sure. First of all, take a deep breath and get your emotions in check or you might blurt out – “If you don’t do it for yourself, at least think about MY inheritance!” I’m not sure – but I’m thinking that’s probably not a good move. Come prepared with the facts, not just your vague feelings about why they should protect themselves from fraud. Be prepared with personal stories you’ve heard from friends (or from cops or lawyers – those are always impactful). Make sure you are in a quiet area away from distractions so you can both concentrate on the conversation. I always like to say – “Let the silence do the heavy lifting.” If you were a victim of fraud, confide that to your aging loved one in an effort to ease the potentially awkward conversation. Being scammed can be very embarrassing, and on many occasions, victims go to their graves without telling a sole – empathy can go a long way in these situations.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Show and Tell:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> The best way to help your aging loved one genuinely understand the havoc a scammer can wreak on all of your lives is by using real-life stories – especially if it involves someone they know! These accounts of actual scams are not hard to uncover. All it takes is getting a few of your friends together for coffee or cocktails and simply asking them if they know anyone, or if any of their aging loved ones, have been scammed. If your friends claim they are somehow immune to fraudsters, fat chance, they are more likely too embarrassed to expose that their “brilliant parent” took the bait. You can easily enter “worst elderly scam ever” in a search engine; you’ll have no problem finding a story that will have you calling a fraud prevention expert in a minute!</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Make it Relatable: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the reasons why I have had so much success training older adults (and their families) about the multitude of fraud threats out there is because I know how to present the information in a way that they can understand. One of the most important ways to do this is by explaining how different today is from yesteryear, not in a patronizing way. So, let’s use the example of simply tossing your paper bills in the trash without shredding them and how this can very easily lead to identity theft. Your parents may still think it would be unusual for a “non-Mafia” related criminal to go through their old food cartons and banana peels to get their bank account number or Medicare data (this action is commonly referred to as “dumpster diving”). Oh, and don’t forget their address, and in many cases, their date of birth is frequently on these documents. A fraudster's GOLDMINE! Make sure you involve your loved one in the conversations don’t just make it one-sided. Ask them why and how they think things have changed as it related to fraudsters. This is a great ice breaker to start the conversation about how scams have evolved over the years.</span></li>
</ul>
<strong>DID YOU KNOW? The term ""dumpster diving"" emerged in the 1980s, combining ""diving"" with ""dumpster"", a large commercial trash bin. The term ""Dumpster"" itself comes from the Dempster Dumpster, a company started in 1937 that sold a brand of bins manufactured by the Dempster Brothers.</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b> Look it Up:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> If your parents are a tough sell when it comes to convincing them that they are more of a target than they think, show them the “money,” and your favorite search engine will help you do that very quickly. Just ask them to type their name into an online search engine. If they have never searched their name on the Internet, I feel they will be astonished. I would recommend that you do this experiment in advance just in case they have no web presence – it will be a bust otherwise! If that is what happens, use either yourself or another family member or friend, they know as the fraudsters example target. By doing this, it will help them see firsthand how much information is readily available about all of us online. It will also allow you to say things like, “Wow, can you imagine a fraudster might use this information?” It is much simpler to articulate the danger that comes with certain kinds of technology if you allow your aging loved ones to see for themselves how much of our personal information is out there in the ether.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> PRO TIP: If you want to help prevent your parents, or your, every move from being widely distributed online, you might want to consider using a more private search engine. Most search engines will track your movement around the web and ambush you with personalized messages. This is why I use a privacy-oriented search engine called <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com/"">DuckDuckGo</a>. On their website, DuckDuckGo claims they “Don't store your personal information or follow you around with ads. We don't track you. Ever.” There are several other reputable private search options, such as <a href=""https://www.qwant.com/"">Qwant</a> and <a href=""https://www.startpage.com/"">Startpage</a>.</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>No Money, No Worries:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> This response is oh so common when I am giving a lecture on scams, especially when it comes to identity theft. Many older adults, people in general, read stories about celebrities or athletes and see their big houses and fancy jewelry and cannot fathom that a fraudster would waste time going after their measly little $50K in their retirement fund. Let me start by saying that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">money</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">money, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and scammers will take it in any denomination! That being said, money is not the only thing they are after; they are also anxious to steal your personal information for a myriad of other reasons. One of the scariest examples you could give is what could happen when a fraudster steals your aging loved one’s health information and either sells it or impersonates them when visiting doctors. Even worse, they pretend they are you and have major surgery! This activity happens much more often than you might think! </span><a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Medicare.gov</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> says that if someone calls you and asks for your Medicare Number or other personal information, hang up and call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). If you suspect identity theft or feel like you gave your personal information to someone you shouldn't have, contact the </span><a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Federal Trade Commission</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Prove It:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Many of the examples you give your parents of scams happening out there may seem so foreign to them that you need to take a different route by very subtly passing information on to them about actual scams taking place today. If you share official scam alerts with your aging loved ones regularly, they will begin to get used to the fact that this is all, not just a farce – it is reality. The “AHA” moment happens when you’ve sent them an alert and low and behold; they hear about it again from a friend or on the news - OR - if they personally get a call or email from a scammer using the same theme. I always tell my clients that their loved ones might seem like they’re not listening to you – but believe me, they are, and they will especially remember what you said if they hear it again from another source. Many organizations even allow you and your loved ones to sign up to receive email or text notifications of new fraud alerts so that you don’t have to be the one keeping track of the latest scams all the time.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PRO TIP: When you share an official scam alert with your parents, it adds credibility to the concern, especially when the alert comes from a federal agency or a reputable company. A few online sources for alerts include <a href=""http://myfraudalerts.com/"">MyFraudAlerts.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud"">FBI Common Fraud Schemes Database</a>, the <a href=""https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/scam-alerts"">Federal Trade Commission Most Recent Scam Alerts List</a>, <a href=""https://cp.email.aarp.org/fraudwatchsignup?intcmp=AE-SCM-FRD-SIGNUP"">AARP Fraud Watch Network</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/uac/Tax-Scams-Consumer-Alerts"">IRS Tax Scams and Consumer Alerts Newsroom</a>.</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Leave Behind the Leaflets:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> I’ve noticed that very frequently, clients will attend a fraud prevention lecture I have given, and while they are there, they will act like this could never happen to them. As a part of the education process, I leave each attendee with informative blogs or how-to-articles that they can read later. When all of the scary stories I’ve told them begin to sink in, they are frequently ready to put some of the best fraud prevention practices we discussed in place! So, when you’re talking to your aging loved ones, be sure to leave them with some information they can peruse on their own time, and don’t forget to mention the fact that you used these resources in the past and felt they were extremely helpful. Not to worry, they are heeding your advice – you just might not feel it sometimes!</span></li>

6203,"Tell-Tale Signs You’ve Been Scammed","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Frauds and scams can take many forms, and that’s one of the things that makes them so hard to detect. Your aging loved ones can be scammed on or offline, via the phone (cell or landline), snail-mail, door to door, etc. </span><a href=""https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/blog/seven-signs-youre-being-scammed""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">MoneyAdviceServices.org</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> wrote a great article that will help you learn more about what signs you should look out for so that you, or your loved ones, can prevent a scam before it’s too late! Here are some of the suggestions that I found most useful.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>A Company Contacts You Out of the Blue</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. If a company you’ve never dealt with before is contacting you out of the blue and is asking you for money - be very wary. To ensure they are who they say, go to their official website, call the number from listed and determine if it is legitimate (don’t use any contact details the original caller has given you). If it’s a financial services company, check the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to confirm they are legitimate. If it turns out the company is genuine, the operator can forward you back to the person you were talking to, and if not - they have been made aware that someone is using their brand in a fraudulent manner.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>You’ve Been Rejected for Credit.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> If you’ve always had excellent credit, but suddenly you’re being rejected, there’s a good chance that someone has assumed your identity and is pretending to be you to steal money, goods or services. In order to be able to act quickly if something is awry, it’s always worth checking your credit report (at least monthly) to make sure fraudsters aren’t submitting false applications for credit in your name.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>You’re Being Rushed.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> No legitimate company will rush you into a decision to hand over sensitive information or make you fork out money with an unreasonable deadline. Scammers like to instill a sense of fear or urgency as a tactic to bully you into action, so you don’t have time to ask for help or think through a purchase.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>You’re Being Asked for Your PIN Number.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> A bank will never ask you for your PIN number or any other online banking passwords. If at any point you become suspicious of someone saying they are from your bank, hang up and call them back from a number the official bank website has written on its ‘contact us’ page.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Lots of Misspellings and Bad Grammar</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Most emails from major companies are proofread and checked. If an email claiming to come from someone in a position of power arrives with lots of spelling and grammatical errors, be suspicious. Scammers don’t necessarily have a good education, or maybe come from a different country - therefore, they might not have the language skills you would expect.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>The Website Doesn’t Have a Secure Link.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> It’s really easy to be fooled by a fake website as scammers can fake an official-looking email, using the same logo and email design as the real company. When using web pages, you need to make sure the site has a secure link. The easiest way to do this to check if there’s a padlock symbol in the browser. Does the link start with ‘https://’? The ‘s’ stands for secure - stay away from any site that doesn’t have it!</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>You Have a Virus.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Scammers use computer viruses to gain access to your computer details, which allows them to steal your identity and money. They may also get into your WIFI network for the same reason. Viruses are small computer programs that try and infect other computers, tablets, and smartphones. Once they’re in your computer, they spread from one device to another, usually by a dodgy link or download. They can secretly monitor your computer activity, scan for passwords, and even take control of your computer. </span></li>

6206,"Bank, Credit Card, and Identity Theft Prevention Checklists","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Very few people are able to avoid fraudulent emails, texts, or calls. If you think you are one of the lucky few, it most likely just means that at the moment, you didn’t detect what was happening! As fraud prevention experts, we always say that every person we’ve met has either been scammed themselves, knows someone who has been scammed, or will be scammed at some point. Unfortunately, this is a reality, and these thieves are always one step ahead working on the next trick they have up their sleeves. This is bittersweet for us because, of course, it offers job security, but most people in this industry got into it out of passion because they, or their loved ones, were targeted by fraud. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that being said, I suggest you always be on the defense when it comes to the potential that you might become a part of a fraudulent situation. I’ve put together checklists to help you start the process of protecting your bank accounts, credit cards, and personal identity from hackers and fraudsters. These are a good start but know there is a ton more you can do if you want to create tight security around your money and personal identity.</span>

<b>Bank Fraud Checklist:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep all of your personal contact information up to date so that your bank can immediately contact you if they see unusual activity on any of your accounts. This includes your address, land/mobile phone number, and email address. </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Review your transactions on a regular basis to make sure no one has misused your account. The faster you can uncover that theft has occurred, the more likely the bank can try to figure out who is responsible for hacking your account.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Create the strongest possible passwords. A strong password means a strong defense against hackers. Strong passwords are 8 or more characters long and include a combination of numbers, symbols, and upper- and lowercase letters</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do not ever write your PIN number on the back of your debit card - don’t laugh; people actually do this on a regular basis!</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Protect your devices. Keeping your phone, tablet, and computer up to date with the latest browsers and operating systems helps protect against weaknesses that hackers can exploit. Be sure to enroll in automatic app updates so that you routinely receive the latest security updates.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Know the red flags that signal fraudulent activity. Scammers often pressure people to send money, threaten law enforcement action, or demand gift cards as a form of payment. If you provide your personal data or money to a fraudster, there is often not much your bank can do to get your money back.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To help you stay current on your transactions and quickly notice fraudulent dealings, enroll in the push alerts that are offered by your bank. In order to quickly review your alerts, request that they are delivered via email or text.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Credit Card Fraud Checklist:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Frequently review your credit card statement online or on your mobile app, to make sure there is no fraudulent activity or unusual charges on your card; if you see any, immediately report them to the card provider.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don't toss your credit card billing statements or expired/canceled cards directly into the trash. Shred these items to keep “dumpster divers” from getting their hands on your credit card number. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PRO TIP: If your aging loved ones are “computer-friendly”, do your best to get them to go paperless – especially with items that could be sensitive like financial statements and health reports. Remind them that printing out the document to read it, and then throwing it “pre-shredded” into the trash puts them at risk.</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make sure to confirm the amount on your credit card receipt before signing it. If you get a credit card receipt that has blank areas in it, write $0 in those spaces or draw through them before signing. Otherwise, the vendor could write in an amount and send the purchase to your credit card issuer.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Only give your credit card number out (or any other sensitive information) on calls that you initiate. Don't return calls to a credit card issuer’s phone number if it was left on your answering machine or sent to you in an email or text message. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PRO TIP: When you call your credit card issuer's customer service center, always use the number on the back of your credit card or on their website. Otherwise, you may be using a fake number that will direct you to a fraudulent credit card scam.</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even if an email looks authentic, do not click on email links from anyone that appears to be your credit card company, bank, or other business using your personal information. These links are often what are called phishing scams. </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Be careful when you're using your credit card for online purchases. Only enter your credit card number on secure websites that you can be 100% sure are legitimate. To confirm a website is secure, look for https:// in the address field and a padlock icon in the status or address bar of your internet browser. </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Report a stolen, lost, or missing credit card as soon as possible. The sooner your credit card issuer can cancel your card and prevent fraudulent charge the better. Put your credit card companies' customer service number in your contact database, so you'll have it handy if your credit cards are ever missing.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your credit card number is probably stored on a number of websites online. For instance, you may have your credit card saved on Amazon, so you can make one-click purchases. Be sure to use strong passwords everywhere - but especially online.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep your credit cards safe from thieves by placing them in a wallet or purse close to your body where they can't easily be snatched away.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Identity Theft Checklist:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Get your free credit report from annualcreditreport.com and check for discrepancies. Consumers are eligible to receive one free report from the major credit bureaus every year. Take the time to review it thoroughly, if you have any questions call the credit bureau ASAP.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember that your kids aren’t immune to identity theft. Make sure you contact each credit bureau to see if a credit report for your child exists; if so, make sure you review that as well. </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consider placing a voluntary credit freeze with each bureau. A credit freeze makes it much more difficult for someone to open a new account in your name. Just remember that when you apply for credit, you must unlock the credit freeze.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Log in and change the passwords on any sensitive websites (insurance, investment, bank, etc.) on a regular basis to make sure that they are secure. I would suggest you also routinely change your username, if possible.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Review the account activity of any of your financial sites or any additional websites that store your credit card number or other sensitive personal information on a regular basis.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your driver’s license is lost or stolen, immediately call your state motor vehicle office to make a report. One of the frequent ways that people’s identity is stolen begins when they lose their license or passport, both credentials list tons of personal information on them.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Closely review the statements from your health insurance plan, especially if you are over 65 and on Medicare. Make sure the claims that were paid match the care you actually received. On many occasions, when your identity is stolen those that are uninsured or underinsured will take on your identifiable information and use it when they go to see a doctor or are admitted into the hospital.</span></li>

6209,"Talking to Your Parents After the Scam","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many older adults grew up in an era when trusting one another was more the norm than the outlier. A solid handshake took the place of a signed contract, and locked doors weren’t common - everyone was welcome! Today we live in a society that is fraught with security challenges, and we all must adapt. Our aging loved ones might have a blind trust in others that could eventually position them as a perfect target for disreputable fraudsters. It is always tough to figure out the best way to talk to your loved one after they’ve been scammed. When a loved one has been scammed, compassion for the victim is a critical initial step to help them start moving forward in a healthy and productive manner. The most important first action is to make sure you approach them with empathy rather than anger. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of my clients was so distraught when they came to my office to report that they needed help because they were swindled out of thousands of dollars in what’s called a charity scam. Every time there is a horrible natural disaster somewhere in the world, vile fraudsters are the first to send emails that pull your heartstrings and relay how important it is for you to financially support the victims of the disaster. These scams can be very elaborate, with scammers even going to the length of creating fake organizations (imitating real ones) to fleece kind donors. Before my client and I launched into a full investigation, I took a moment to tell her what an incredibly generous and giving person she is and how so many people fall for these types of scams. She immediately calmed down and was able to tell me the details of what happened. By reacting from a place of empathy, the situation became easier for both of us!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tread lightly as most victims are extremely embarrassed and often report they are left feeling vulnerable and fragile. Victims are afraid to tell their family when an event like this happens because they fear they will be perceived as unwise, incompetent, and perhaps no longer capable enough to handle their own finances. Research cites that only 1 in 4 older adults who are scammed inform the police or even tell family and friends because they feel humiliated and ashamed.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some of my clients have even told me that they did not report a scam to their adult children because they were frightened that they would be forced to move into a retirement or assisted living community. One woman confided that when she told her son about the foolish romance scam she fell for, and the $175,000 she was eventually swindled out of, her son got violent and started hitting her because she had, quote, “pissed away his inheritance.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember, although you may not find out about a scam from your loved “verbally,” there might be other signs that demonstrate something is off. Perhaps their overall personality and body language seem to have changed. They may remove themselves or withdraw from contact with you or seem less comfortable having what once seemed like a normal discussion about their money. When an individual has been involved in a scam, they experience a myriad of emotions, including guilt, anger, and depression, so look out for any mental health warning signs as well.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the flip side, also be sure to look out for yourself - I call this “caring for the caregiver.” I have seen many cases where the adult child of a loved one who has been scammed feels helpless and frustrated when their loved one is in denial or will not openly discuss what happened. You want to try to open up the lines of communication as much as you can because the more information you can ascertain, the less arduous it will be to try and put their affairs back in order.  Try to stay calm, even if it seems they have lost a ton of their money, be as patient and supportive as possible, and certainly don’t enter a conversation being patronizing or chastising them for their mistake. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How your loved one’s support system handles the aftermath of a fraud experience can seriously impact their level of comfort around sharing what happened and their overall healing process. If you respond with anger, your loved one will most likely shut down, and the tension will cause the situation to become even worse. Occurrences like this can be one of the most traumatic events one might experience, especially if the victim is on a fixed income and has lost a great deal of money that cannot be recouped. It may be wise to speak to a professional or engage a third party to help you talk through some of the next steps and help temper the emotions involved in the process.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you, or your loved one, have been the victim of a scam, it’s important to report it and get the help you need. You may not always be able to get your money back, but hopefully, you can diminish the damage, start healing, and take appropriate steps to prevent something like this from happening to you again in the future. </span>

6217,"What Are the Most Common Types of Scams?","Swindles come in all shapes and sizes – they can be massive or minuscule, hi-tech, or basic. They can originate from a knock on the front door or an identity listing on the dark web. No matter what the method, malicious fraudsters behind scams have one thing in common. They want to steal their targets money or identity, all while avoiding being caught!

In addition to cash, the most highly sought-after items include personal data such as your bank account number, credit card information, driver’s license, investment accounts, contact information and, Social Security number. Last year the top frauds reported were victims scammed by individuals pretending to be from a familiar business, the government, or a supposed romantic interest.  The more you learn about the types of scams out there, the less likely you will fall for a scammer’s mischievous antics.

There are hundreds of different scams occurring every day, so it would be impossible for you to know about all of them. If you sign up to receive biweekly scam alerts from <a href=""http://www.myfraudalerts.com/"">MyFraudAlerts.com</a> – a list of the most current scams will come directly to you via email or text. Below is a list of some of the more common scams you and your loved ones should look out for going forward.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Anti-Aging Product Scam:</strong> Lotions and potions to help you look younger is BIG business. Unfortunately, many scammers offer products that have absolutely no anti-aging remedy whatsoever. Whether it’s bogus homeopathic therapies or fake Botox scam like the one that earned its distributors millions of dollars in barely a year (before they were ultimately convicted and jailed), there is plenty of dough in the anti-aging business.</li>
 	<li><strong>Charity Scam:</strong> Every time there’s a horrible natural disaster somewhere in the world, despicable fraudsters are the first to send emails that pull your heartstrings to articulate how important it is for you to support the disaster victims financially. These scams can be very intricate, with scammers even going to the length of inventing fake organizations (imitating real ones) to con empathetic donors.</li>
 	<li><strong>Counterfeit Prescription Drugs Scam:</strong> As prices for prescription drugs continue to increase, seniors, and their caregivers, scour the web to find less expensive options for their medications. Scammers are privy to this and have consequently created websites that advertise cheap prescription drugs, which unfortunately are frequently counterfeit.</li>
 	<li><strong>Foreclosure Relief Scam:</strong> The goal of a foreclosure scam is to attempt to take (steal) your money or your house. These scams often involve a fraudster making a false promise of saving you from foreclosure. Fraudsters may ask for money in advance with the promise of a guarantee that you can get your mortgage terms changed. Do not fall for this scam - if you’re having trouble making your monthly mortgage payments, a HUD-approved housing counselor can walk you through your options for free. You can search online for a <a href=""https://apps.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm"">housing counseling agency</a>near you or call HUD's interactive voice system at (800) 569-4287.</li>
 	<li><strong>Foreign Lottery Scam:</strong> I get inquiries all the time from people asking me if I think they might have won XXX million from a lottery scheme in Nigeria – UH NO! I DO NOT!!! AARP says that if you receive a letter, email, text or phone call from a foreign lottery saying, “All you have to do to collect your winnings is to wire money to the caller for taxes or a processing fee” – PLEASE save us both time and just hit delete or hang up. The reality is that foreign lotteries are illegal and besides, think about it, if you’ve never entered a foreign lottery, it’s not likely you won!</li>
 	<li><strong>Funeral Scam:</strong> I like to refer to this as a “trickle-down” scam – fraudsters are targeting your money after your loved one has died. In one type of funeral scheme, fraudsters use obituaries to find out information about the deceased to extort money from family members or grieving spouses. They claim the deceased has an outstanding debt that must be paid immediately. Those close to the deceased are usually in a vulnerable state and are more likely to pay the fraudulent debt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gold and Silver Coin Scam:</strong> This one has been around forever, but folks are still falling for it – in droves! Up pops an ad on your TV or computer describing the “impending recession” that details how valuable investing in gold and silver coins is during unpredictable times. Although, in some cases, it might be true that these coins are valuable - in this case, the coins are being sold at a 300-500% markup, and you’ll undoubtedly lose money upon purchase.</li>
 	<li><strong>Grandparent Scam:</strong> A scammer calls your aging loved one pretending to be their grandson or granddaughter. They tell the victim they had their wallet stolen, were arrested for drunken driving, or are in some other kind financial trouble, and they need you to wire them money ASAP. This scam is particularly devious because it plays on older adult’s emotions. In most cases, the fraudster will ask the grandparent not to tell anyone about the money exchange and will continue to contact them and ask them to send more money.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PRO TIP: Grandparent scammers may have gotten your grandson’s name from social media, or they wait for you to say, “Is this Joey?” and then they continue the ruse. A fraudster might ask you if you know who is calling, and when you guess the name of one of your grandchildren, they pretend to be that person.</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Imposter Scam:</strong> Imposter scammers try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone, normally of authority, that you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organizer. Remember, caller ID can be faked. If you feel suspicious, you should always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them, and if they are trying to raise funds, before giving any money.</li>
 	<li><strong>Investment Scam:</strong> Fraudsters will often tell an older adult that if they invest money in a particular scheme, they will earn very high returns with minimal financial risk. You know the old saying, “If it sounds too good to be true - it probably IS!” Many older fraud victims say that they didn’t expect to live so long. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard, “Well, my Dad died of a heart attack when he was 52, so I just figured the same scenario was inevitable for me.” If your aging loved one is concerned about their finances, stay alert as their desperation to create another line of income might make them more susceptible to investment fraud.</li>
 	<li><strong>Intimidation Scam:</strong> Scammers threaten you with violence, a lawsuit, or even arrest over supposed missed payments; you're told to pay immediately to avoid a fake court summons and subsequent incarceration. Next, the scammer lets you know that “conveniently enough,” they can accept credit cards or cash right there on the spot. Sometimes the fraudster will come right to your aging loved one’s door – and as you can imagine, that can be frightening. It’s common for crooks to use Facebook and other online sites to collect personal information about you and your family to make their threats seem real. The lesson here is to limit what you post online.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PRO TIP: Whatever you do, don’t underestimate a scammer – they are studying you and your loved ones and are coming for you armed with as much information as they can glean from any of your public profiles. AARP reports that those entertaining Facebook quizzes may seem like harmless fun, but the Better Business Bureau and digital-security companies warn that swindlers sometimes use quizzes to capture your personal data. Launching a quiz app may give its creators permission to pull information from your profile, offering hackers an entrée to steal your online identity. They also say to look out for “innocent-sounding” queries about your first car or high school mascot. Con artists know these are common security questions that banks and financial firms use to protect your accounts.</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Scam:</strong> Fraudsters will send you a message through email, snail mail, text, or call you in an attempt to gain access to your tax or banking information to steal your identity and money. I feel confident you know this – however, it bears repeating - the IRS will <strong>never</strong> call you to demand immediate payment or discuss taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill<strong>.</strong> Some scammers send <u>fake</u> letters to try and trick taxpayers, hoping that folks will take the bait – so be careful on that front as well. If you’re not sure if a letter you received is legitimate, you can always call the IRS directly at (800) 829-1040.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>PRO TIPS: Below are seven tips to help you spot whether an IRS letter is authentic or fake. A legitimate IRS letter will:</strong></p>

<ol>
 	<li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Generally arrive in a government envelope and will include the IRS seal on the notice or letter.</strong></li>
 	<li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Include a letter or notice number, most commonly found at the top right-hand corner.</strong></li>
 	<li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Typically contain your truncated tax ID or Social Security number and note the tax year(s) on the top right-hand corner.</strong></li>
 	<li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>State the IRS contact information - usually, a 1-800 number found at the top of the letter near your identifying information.</strong></li>
 	<li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Include supplementary information about your rights as a taxpayer, such as explaining your appeal rights and other options.</strong></li>
 	<li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Not threaten to arrest or deport you.</strong></li>
 	<li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Note your payment options, such as how to pay an outstanding balance.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Job Scam:</strong> This scam scenario may not be common with your aging loved ones since they are retired in many cases. That being said, it is a very prevalent scam, so I do want to make you aware of it just in case. Con artists trying to take advantage of job seekers have been posting bogus job offers on various employment websites. A scammer’s goal might be to collect confidential information to use for identity theft, tempt you to pay for services or supplies you don’t need, or try to get you to cash fraudulent checks or wire and send money. The scammer may also use or sell the personal information you provided in your job application.</li>
 	<li><strong>Medicare Scam:</strong> Fraudsters will pose as Medicare representatives to get seniors to give them their personal information, including their Medicare ID or Social Security number. The scammer will use this information to bill Medicare for fake services and then pocket the money. These scammers also may use the information to visit a doctor or go to the hospital if they have no insurance. This scenario can be extremely scary, especially if their medical conditions are intermingled with yours in your chart. I had a client who had a stroke and was admitted to the hospital - her chart said (erroneously) that she had severe hypertension, and she was therefore given a significant dose of high blood pressure (BP) medicine. It turned out someone with severe hypertension had stolen her Medicare credentials and was being prescribed a very high dose of BP medicine in her name.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mortgage Scam:</strong> Older adults who own their homes are often considered to be very valuable targets for scammers. An imposter might send an official-looking, yet fraudulent, letter to a homeowner that details the assessed value of their home (information that is easily gleaned from the area property tax commission). Fraudsters let the homeowner know that, for a fee, the value of their home can be reassessed. Scammers might also approach your aging loved one offering home repairs and coerce them to take out equity to use as payment for the repairs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Online Romance Scam:</strong> Older adults need to be super cautious when they are looking for love online. Just last year in the United States, more than 27,000 consumers filed a report with the FTC about romance scams - most “sweetheart” scams go unreported due to embarrassment. This type of fraud not only positions your aging loved to lose money…their heart can be stolen as well! Criminals often create fake profiles on social media and dating sites in an attempt to find a match and convince your aging loved one to help them financially. The fraudster is routinely someone posing as a doctor or military officer, stationed far away, who just needs money to come to see them but ‘lo and behold’ they never show up at the airport.</li>
 	<li><strong>Social Security Scam:</strong> Individuals pose as benefits investigators claiming there is a problem with your Social Security account. At times, they will tell you your Social Security number has been suspended and give you a false number to call in order to “resolve” the issue. When you call them back, what’s the first thing that happens? For “security reasons,” the fraudster asks you, or your aging loved one, for your name, date of birth, and the Social Security number that was referenced in the message. Once provided, they now have all the information needed to connect the dots and promptly steal your identity.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PRO TIP: The Social Security Administration (SSA) suggests you create a <a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount""><em>my</em> Social Security</a> account to help you keep track of your records and identify any suspicious activity. SSA says it does not track data on the prevalence of identity theft. Still, they advise the public that the best way to avoid problems is to create an account to “take away the risk of someone else trying to create one in your name, even if they obtain your Social Security number.”</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Sweepstakes Scam:</strong> This scheme usually involves a fraudster contacting an older victim either by mail or telephone and informing them that they have won a prize of some sort but must pay a fee to obtain the award. Scammers send a fake check to the senior to deposit in their bank account, knowing it will take some time for the bank to reject the check. Meanwhile, the victim has sent the scammer money through wire transfer for fees or “taxes” on the prize.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tech Support Scam:</strong> You or your aging loved one gets a call or a popup warning that your computer has a virus. You are then told that if you will hand over remote access to your computer the person on the other end can fix the problem. Afraid of the consequences of inaction, many older adults allow the con to take remote control of their computer, at which point the scammer actually <u>does</u> install a menacing virus and charges them to remove it, or they will convince them to purchase a computer maintenance program that is worthless!</li>
 	<li><strong>Travel Scam:</strong> Many older adults dream of spending their retirement years traveling for weeks on end. Your loved one receives a solicitation saying they can enjoy steep discounts on travel to many parts of the world by joining a travel club if they just pay a fixed fee (that is often in the thousands of dollars). Unfortunately, the senior finds out later that the discounted fares for cruises and other travel were either not as low as represented or even worse, not available at all.</li>
